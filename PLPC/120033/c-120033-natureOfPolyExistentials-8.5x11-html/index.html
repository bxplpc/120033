<!--TOC chapter id="sec4" Preface-->
<h1 id="sec4" class="chapter">Chapter 1  Preface</h1><!--SEC END --><div class="flushleft"><p>Economics is full of externalities. Horrible things happen when
market value deviates from true value. The harm is even more
horrific when economics is the main pilar of societies.</p><p>Often it takes time to understand correct new true values and correct new
market values. It can even take longer to correct such divergences.
In the case of fossil fuels and global warming, we may well be too
late in correcting the relevant economic deviations.</p><p>Divergence of market value from true value may have various reasons and various
dynamics. The deviation is particularly devastating when it is through ownership
rules. Ownership rules are man made constructs which can be slanted to
economically benefit one group at the expense of another group.</p><p>Rules for ownership of Africans by Americans and Europeans,
resulted in reduction of the economic value of labor to the
benefit of Americans and Europeans. This was accomplished by
deemphasizing true value of Africans as human beings. Horrible
things happened when market value of Africans deviated from true
value of Africans. Some three hunder years or so later, this is
even mostly clear and generally recognized by the old masters
(Americans and Europeans), but no corrective economic measures
(reparations) has been made. Reprocautions of such economically
motivated ownership rules are vast and may remain uncomprehended
in parts.</p><p>Something similar is happeing today with respect to the Western
Intelectual Property Rights(IPR) regime. This time, things are
more complicated. The victims are not easily identifiable and the
harm is not immediately recognizable. Yet, the scope has become
global and long term ramifications are perhaps even more
disastrous.</p><p>Knowledge, know-how, ideas and information are inherently
non-scarce. They are <span style="font-weight:bold">polyexistentials</span>. Unlike <span style="font-weight:bold">monoexistentials</span>
which exist in singular, polyexistentials naturally exist in
multiples and are inherently not scarce.</p><p>What is non-scarce in nature is being made artificially scarce
through man made ownership rules called Copyright and Patents.
These ownership rules then permit a certain group which usually
take the form of corporations (legal entities) to economically
profit from these unnatural and economically motivated artificial
scarcities. The market value of the know-how to make the Covid
vaccine is artificially inflated comapred to the true non-scarce
value of that know-how, so we ended up with less of the more
expensive Covid vaccines. Through the Western IPR regime, market
value of know-how has been diverging from its true value. As a
result, horrible things have been happening, but people have been
conditioned not to worry about these. Power of corporations have
been amplified. Autonomy and privacy of the individuals has been
quashed and rendered irrelevant. Professions are being
marginalized. People all over the world are being subjected to
the Americanization process. Huamnity is being destroyed.</p><p>In this book we analyze the topic of Intellectual Property
Rights (IPR) from a new perspective. The topic of restriction of
polyexistentials and Western IPR are one and the same. Yet, the
concept of polyexistentials has not appeared in prior discussions
of this topic. This is the very first time that the concept and
the word “polyexistetials” are being introduced.</p><p>The model of polyexistence makes it easy to prove that the
concept of Intellectual Property is erroneous. This proof is
based on logic that is rooted in nature of existence and nature
of possession and the requirement for ownership to be in harmony
with nature of possession and existence.</p><p>Based on philosophy, nature and logic we present a case that
makes it clear that Western IPR regime is in conflict with nature
and is obviously fraudulent. The logic that demonstrates
polyexistentials are unownable is sufficient to pursuade anyone
who thinks with his brain and whose interests do not conflict
with the natural conclusions of our discourse.</p><p>But human rationality is a myth. Both individually and in groups
people don’t think with their brain. People think with their
character. Dominant aspects of their character that impact their
thinking are self-interest and their value system.</p><p>Over the past two hundred years or so a great deal has been
invested to cultivate the myth of merits of western IPR regime.
Many generations have been born inside of this mistake. Very
many are so very vested in preservation of the myth of IPR that
our logic will likely not prove sufficient. So, we spend a good
part of this book on debunking various arguments that have been
put forward to preserve and further cultivate IPR.</p><p>We are asked to believe that the artificial competitive
environment that Western IPR regime creates is superior to the natural
collaborative environment. What westerners see in others is a
reflection of their own <span style="font-weight:bold">self-toxication</span>. We are asked to
believe that people are economic creatures. We, humans, are more
than economic creatures.</p><p>The detrimental effects of the Western IPR regime include the
obstruction of engineering creativity, a distortion of the
competitive business environment, and denial of the benefits
thereof to the public. Our profession, the software and internet
engineering profession, is hindered by the Intellectual Property
Rights (IPR) regime. As engineers instead of being able to freely
collaborate, we are enticed to compete. Instead of collectively
inventing and innovating towards the good of society, the Western
IPR model pushes us to individually reinvent. Our intimacy and
knowledge of internet application services has positioned us to
better understand the harms of IPR on privacy and autonomy of
individuals. Our profession, has a responsibility to society and
we have a responsibility to our profession. It is towards
fulfillment of our responsibilities to our profession and our
profession’s responsibility to society and humanity that we have
prepared this book.</p><p>Having rejected the western IPR regime as a wrong model for
govenrnance of polyexistentials, towards
<span style="font-weight:bold">proper governance of polyexistentals</span> we first introduce
the potent and sensitive word “<span style="font-weight:bold">Halaal</span>”. We then
introduce the <span style="font-weight:bold">Libre-Halaal</span> label for the
<span style="font-weight:bold">halaal manner-of-existence of polyexistentials</span> through
which we facilitate <span style="font-weight:bold">conviviality of tools</span>. Based on
that, we then provide definitional criteria for
<span style="font-weight:bold">Libre-Halaal Software</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">Libre-Halaal Content</span> and
<span style="font-weight:bold">Libre-Halaal Internet Services</span>.</p><p>We use the metaphor of a societal disease to highlight the harms
of Western IPR regime and trace the roots of this disease to
“<span style="font-weight:bold">Americanism</span>”.</p><p>The American internet is based on American values and the
American digital ecosystem is a product of American
corporatocracy. In America, the user’s autonomy and privacy is
now the implicit internet currency and American corporations have
established necessary mechanism to translate that to hard cash
— they call it “Surveillance Capitalism.” Outside of America,
American internet corporations function as the surveillance and
propaganda arms of the U.S. government and its American values.
As of 2022, almost 90% of Facebook’s daily active users come
from outside the US. When necessary, American internet
corporations happily collaborate with the US government towards
foreign espionage and foreign exploitations. Together, these two
then put on a charade. From time-to-time the government speaks of
anti-trust and regulation of monopolies. And Facebook says we
need more privacy guidance! In the meantime, people are being
conditioned to accept more of loss of autonomy and privacy as
side effects of American surveillance capitalism. As if the
American Internet can be fixed on its fringes.</p><p>No. The American internet can not be fixed. Instead, the American
internet model should be fully rejected and a different model is
needed. We have built <span style="font-weight:bold">The Libre-Halaal By* (ByStar) Digital
Ecosystem</span>, as a moral alternative to the existing models for
internet services and software.
Equipped with a <span style="font-weight:bold">multidisciplinary blueprint</span>, we offer
our initial implementation of the ByStar digital ecosystem as a
starting point towards concrete solutions.</p><p>Todays’s American internet is mostly a business construct. The
current basic model of internet is rooted in the
rise-of-the-middle model of corporations exploiting the
individual. The engineering architecture of the proprietary
internet application services is very central. Proprietary
American corporations the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon,
Microsoft and Apple are positioned in the middle and monitor,
control and expolit citizens of the world.</p><p>The engineering architecture of
Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem is distinctly different.
The multidisciplinary blueprint that we have provided can be the
basis for de-Americanization, de-IPR-ization and
<span style="font-weight:bold">redecentralization</span> of internet application services.
Unlike the central and rise-of-the-middle model of American
internet application services, ByStar design is highly
distributed, decentralized and end and edge oriented.</p><p>ByStar is rooted in the model of mediated and direct interactions
of autonomous edges. For this to function properly, software of
autonomous edges must be internally transparent and un-owned.
Software of ByStar is and must be publicly owned — it is
Libre-Halaal Software.</p><p>ByStar individual services represent real individuals in the
real world. In ByStar, real individuals have real autonomy, real
control and real ownership of their own ByStar individual
services. ByStar individual services are edge-oriented and can be
externally-hosted or self-hosted. Each citizen of the world is
offered his/her own
<span style="font-weight:bold">Possesion Assertiable Libre-Halaal Service (PALS)</span>
Through guarantees of possession assertability, PALS provide for
tangible autonomy and privacy for individuals and for societies.</p><p>In the ByStar model each nation and each culture adopts and
nationalizes the publicly owned (humanity owned) global ByStar
digital ecosystem software consistent with its own values —
while preserving the universal ByStar model of autonomy and
privacy of the individual. This is very different from the
proprietary American model of exploitation and this is also very
different from national reactions and responses to the
proprietary American model.</p><p>The core software of Bystar Libre-Halaal Services is the
<span style="font-weight:bold">Universal BISOS
(ByStar Internet Services Operating System)</span>. The entirety of
BISOS is Libre-Halaal Software. Engineering design of BISOS is
towards redecentralization of internet application services and
privacy and autonomy of the individual.</p><p>We are devout monoexistential bounded-corporations capitalists.
We are pro-business. The existing capitalist model for
monoexistentials is generally correct, in both philosophical and
economic terms. But the extension of the monoexistential
capitalist model into the domain of polyexistentials, based on
the Western IPR regime, is a grave mistake. To address this
mistake of American Capitalism, we introduce the model of
<span style="font-weight:bold">Global Polyexistential Capitalism</span> as an
<span style="font-weight:bold">Attribution Based Economy</span> towards correcting the
exisiting Ownership Based Economy of
American Capitalism. Deep understanding of the strategy that we
outline in this book, makes it clear that
Polyexistential American Capitalism is very vulnerable.</p><p>What we are trying to do in this book is distinct and different
from the many other books and articles that have been written on
this topic. First, most books on this topic are written by
Western lawyers, politicians, economists, journalist,
sociologists and academics. We are engineers and we are not
Western. Second, this is the very first time that the
philosophical concept of polyexistentials is being used to
analyze this topic and this domain. Third, our threatment of this
subject is genuinely independent. We are not doing it for money
or hype. Fourth, we have tried to be comprehensive and precise in
this book. All the key concepts that are emphasized in bold in
the above text have concrete and precise definitions. Fifth,
unlike most other writings on this topic which amount to naggings
of impotents, we are putting a multidisciplinary blueprint for a
cure on the table. As engineers, we are offering explicit
multidisciplinary solutions.</p><p>Our ultimate goal for all of this has been to influence societal
policies towards adoption of halaal manner-of-existence of
polyexistentials. We recognize that adoption of such societal
policies in America is likely not possible and their adoption in
the West is likely very difficult. Therefore, we focus on Eastern
societies in general and Iran and China in particular.</p><p>It is only through full rejection of the Western IPR regime and its
deep roots in Americanism that humanity can be rescued.</p><div class="minipage">

<!--TOC chapter id="sec5" Introduction-->
<h1 id="sec5" class="chapter">Chapter 2  Introduction</h1><!--SEC END --><p>That which exists in nature in multiples, we call polyexistentials<a id="hevea_default0"></a>.
That which exists in nature in singular, we call
monoexistentials. 
All material objects exist in singular and are monoexistentials<a id="hevea_default1"></a>.
Ideas, information and knowledge exist in nature in multiples — not in
singular. Ideas, Information and knowledge are polyexistentials.
Much of our world is actually a mixture of monoexistentials and
polyexistentials, which we call mixed-existentials<a id="hevea_default2"></a>.</p><p>In this document we analyze the topic of Intellectual Property<a id="hevea_default3"></a>
(IP<a id="hevea_default4"></a>) from a new perspective.
The topic of monopolistic
ownership oriented restriction of polyexistentials and Western 
Intellectual Property Rights<a id="hevea_default5"></a>
(IPR<a id="hevea_default6"></a>)
are one and the same.
Yet, the concept and terminology of polyexistentials has not appeared in
prior discussions of this topic.
This is
the very first time that the concept and the word “polyexistentials”
are being introduced.</p><p>The traditional perspective on Intellectual Property is that, it
is debatable. Some good arguments have been made in its favor and
some good arguments have been made opposing it. Some are for it
and some are against it. It is perceived to be economically more
profitable to be for it, than to be against it. So, in the West,
a whole lot more people are in its favor.</p><p>The model of polyexistence makes it easy to demonstrate and prove
that the concept of Intellectual Property is erroneous. This
proof is based on logic that is rooted in nature of existence and
nature of possession and the requirement for ownership to be in
harmony with nature of possession and existence. Unlike other
writings on this subject, we do not consider this as part of any
debate. In this document we prove that the basic concepts of
Intellectual Property are invalid.</p><p>The IPR regime is about extending the model and
concept of ownership of monoexistentials to the realm of
polyexistentials by creating artificial scarcity. This is against the
nature of polyexistence. </p><p>Ownership of polyexistentials impacts their manner-of-existence
towards being monopolistically controlled and towards becoming internally
opaque. Monopolistic oriented restriction of polyexistentials has
ramifications on autonomy and privacy of the individual and health of
societies. Natural dynamics of Western IP restrictions result in
reduced autonomy and privacy of the individual and result in transfer
of more power to corporations and Corpocracy. Any digital ecosystem that
is rooted in Western IPR puts humanity in danger. A moral alternative
to the American proprietary digital ecosystem (Internet as we know it
today) is called for.</p><p>The first part of this document is concerned with ontology of
polyexistentials. We construct the “Polyexistentials Reference
Model” in order to analyze the nature of what IP restricts.
Polyexistentials are naturally un-scarce and naturally
multi-possessable and naturally un-territorial. Therefore
polyexistentials are unownable. Western IP regime is about
ownership (monopolistic restriction) of polyexistentials. The
concept of polyexistence through the polyexistentials reference
model makes the fraudulence of Western IPR regime clear and
obvious.</p><p>In the second part of this document, we engage in discrediting of the
IPR regime through debunking the arguments that have been put forward in
its support and we address the false beliefs surrounding Western
consensuses. We also put on the table the character of those who
originated it and who are pushing it. Westerners are vested in their
IPR regime. It is not in their interest to understand the invalidity
of IPR. We point out that when a given society gets its
fundamental ownership rules wrong, the consequences are severe. When
most of the world gets its fundamental ownership rules wrong, the
consequences are catastrophic.</p><p>The third and fourth part of this document are about solutions
and cures. We advocate full rejection of the Western IPR regime.
We then advance a specific replacement strategy which includes
societal and global governance models that require halaal
manner-of-existence of polyexistentials. We then propose
construction of a complete ethics oriented digital ecosystem
which has autonomy and privacy of the individual at its core. We
then introduce a starting point for such a digital ecosystem
called: <a href="http://www.by-star.net">The Libre-Halaal ByStar
Digital Ecosystem</a>. Finally, in the fifth part, we postulate a
set of societal strategies that in theory can cure Eastern
societies and do an economic number on Western IPR
vulnerabilities.</p><p>This document is vast in scope and in ambition. And, this
generally public version is just a beginning.
The first and second part are mature and complete enough
to deserve scrutiny. The third, fourth and fifth parts are less ripe.
We draw the contours of what needs to be addressed and convey intent and direction.
We have explicit plans for future editions that focus more on the cure parts.
Throughout, our main goal is to underscore the
importance of this topic and to agitate towards further discussions.</p>

<h2 id="sec6" class="section">2.1  The Nature Of Polyexistentials Makes Them Un-Ownable</h2><!--SEC END --><p>A thesis of this document is that polyexistentials are unownable.
Polyexistentials cannot be proper personal property — or any other type of property.</p><p>Our analysis revolves around the relationships among:
</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Existence
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Possession
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Ownership
</li></ol><p>Existence is a key term in ontology and has been subject of much
analysis and debate. “I think an almost unbelievable amount of false
philosophy has arisen through not realizing what ’existence’
means.” says Bertrand Russell. Here, we are not going to rehash
that topic. Like René Descartes who says: “To know what existence
is, all we have to do is to understand the meaning of the word,
for it tells us at once what the thing is which the word stands,
for, in so far as we can know it. There is no need here for a
definition, which would confuse rather than clarify the issue”,
<sup><a id="text1" href="#note1">1</a></sup>
And like Avicenna (Ibn Sina) who says:
</p><blockquote class="quote">
Being is recognized by reason itself without the aid of
definition or description. Since it has no definition it has
neither genus nor differenzia because nothing is more general
than it. Being does not have a description since nothing is
better known than it.
</blockquote><p>
Here, by existence we mean existence and by being we mean being.</p><p>By possession we mean the act or fact of possessing.
Actual holding or occupancy, either with or without rights of ownership.</p><p>Existence and possession are aspects of nature, but ownership is a human
construct. Ownership, as man made rules, can in theory be anything.
In that sense, anything and everything is ownable. We then draw a
distinction between “proper ownership rules” and “improper
ownership rules”. We consider proper ownership rules as those which
are in harmony with existence and possession aspects of nature and
which result in enduring amelioration of society and humanity. An
acknowledged recent Western improper ownership rule is Americans’ 
ownership rules for Africans as slaves. Existence of humans as equals makes them
unownable. It is in this context that we consider polyexistentials
as ownable or unownable.</p><p>To a certain extent, each society’s ownership rules reflect that
society’s values and character. Intellectual Property as
ownership rules represents the American and Western model for
governance of polyexistentials. Since for Americans, IP is
directly sourced from the U.S. Constitution and since analysis of
ownership involves both the governed (polyexistentials) and the
governor, the American character is on the table. We therefore
need to fully consider it within our scope to analyze and
understand why these people (Americans) have come up with these
ownership rules (IP).</p><p>Ownership rules exisit to resolve conflicts and to improve order in society.
Main ownability requirements are the following:
</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Exclusive Possession — What is to be owned must be possessable
by only one possessor at any given time.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Scarcity — What is plentiful need not be owned.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Territoriality — Assignment of ownership in a given place should not impact
other ownerships in other places. </li><li class="li-enumerate">Harmony with existence of the owned. </li></ol><p>The nature of polyexistentials violates these ownership requirements:
</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Polyexistentials (e.g., ideas, formulas, knowledge) can be possessed
by multiple possessors at the same time.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Each polyexistential can easily be copied and can therefore be plentiful.
Each polyexistential is not scarce.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Each polyexistential can exist in multiple places at the sametime.
Each polyexistential can be possessed by multiple possessors in different places
at the same time. Polyexistentials are non-territorial.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">The concept of polyexistence, as derived from nature
leads to their ownership being un-natural.
</li></ol><p>Polyexistentials are therfore unownable.</p><p>Western Intellectual Property Rights regime 
is an umbrella misnomer to cover the
following branches of US and Western laws:
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
copyright
</li><li class="li-itemize">patent
</li><li class="li-itemize">trademark
</li></ul><p>Copyright, patent and trademark provide for ownership oriented
monopolistic restrictions of polyexistentials. Each of these branches
of Western law directly map to different forms of monopolistic
restriction and ownership of different aspects of certain types
of polyexistentials.</p><p>Since polyexistentials are unownable; copyright, patent and trademark
laws as individual branches of law and collectively as Intellectual
Property Rights regime are therefore invalid.</p><p>Ramifications of incorrect ownership laws can put societies and
humanity at risk.</p><p>Monoexistentials are bounded by their location. The context of
monoexistence is inherently local. Polyexistentials can be in
multiple places at the same time. The context of polyexistence is
inherently un-territorial, global and universal.</p>

IPR regime is a Western construct.
The concepts and vocabulary of IPR are Western and are targeted towards
justification, protections, promotion and propagation of the Western IPR regime.</p><p>The basis of analysis of this document is Eastern.
Many of the concepts that we use to invalidate Western IPR regime are
not rooted in Anglo-American<a id="hevea_default8"></a> English. Through out this document,
there are also a number of important words and concepts that we use in
their Globish sense and not in the Anglo-American<a id="hevea_default9"></a> English (Western)
sense.</p><p>The concepts behind these words, to a large extent, have directed our
analysis and as such are key to understanding this

our exposition.</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Libre:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>
Libre is a substitute for the word free in English which
distinguishes the freedom sense from the gratis sense. Libre in
Globish refers to the sense of freedom in the word “free”. The
other and dominant sense of the word free is gratis (free of
charge). In the context of this document our use of Libre is in the
scope of freedom from Western societal restrictions that come as a result of
IPR regime’s restrictions. This scoping of Libre is different from
FLOSS’s (Free and Libre Open Source Software) scope of the user’s freedom as it applies to Free Software.</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Conviviality Of Tools</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>
By conviviality we refer to the concept of 
“Tools for Conviviality” as Ivan Illich<a id="hevea_default10"></a>
introduced it. <p>Briefly, in Illich’s words:</p><blockquote class="quote">
To the degree that an individual masters his tools, he can invest
the world with his meaning; to the degree that he is mastered by his
tools, the shape of the tool determines his own
self-image. Convivial tools are those which give each person who
uses them the greatest opportunity to enrich the environment with
the fruits of his or her vision. Industrial tools deny this
possibility to those who use them and they allow their designers to
determine the meaning and expectations of others.
</blockquote><p>Western IPR model of polyexistentials leads to industriality of tools
where the tool maker is more in charge.</p><p>The Libre-Halaal<a id="hevea_default11"></a> model of polyexistentials leads to conviviality of

Americanism. In that model, in due course humans become corporotized
economic creatures existing in an exploitative industrial context.

of polyexistentials.</p><p>The analysis presented in this book is multidisciplinary. We have

just a book, but is backed by software and internet application
services. As Libre-Halaal software, the software of ByStar is
publicly available and some ByStar internet application services
are functional and in use. But, ByStar is not just backed by its
software and its internet application services. We have also
created some of the needed structures so that others can join,
participate, and profit. We point to the ByStar Open Business

<h2 id="sec10" class="section">2.5  Our Motivations And Our Purposes</h2><!--SEC END --><p>We are software engineers. The Western IPR regime has crippled our
profession by prohibiting collaboration and transferring more power to
corporate businessmen. This has led to dominance of internally opaque
software and internally opaque internet services. 
Internally opaque
software and internally opaque internet services foster a competitive model 
which stifle engineering collaboration.
Internally opaque
software and internally opaque internet services in turn lead to deterioration of
individual’s autonomy and privacy.</p><p>Our profession, software and internet engineering, has a
responsibility to society and we have a responsibility to our
profession. It is towards fulfillment of our responsibilities to our
profession and our profession’s responsibility to society and humanity
that we have prepared this document.</p><p>Because we have been close to writing of software and creation of internet services,
we understand the ramifications of the Western IPR regime better than many others.
Dynamics of the Western IPR regime are such that they put society and humanity at risk.</p><p>We have concluded that the Western IPR regime is a colossal mistake.</p><p>Let’s say that based on solid logic we could demonstrate that
the bases for establishment of IPR regime is fundamentally wrong and
that IPR regime results in serious harm to society and humanity.
What impact would that have?
Contemporary global mistakes often result in entrenched vested interests. 
Many powerful people and entities are deeply vested in Western IPR.
Such deep
economic interests often prevent people’s willingness to hear and follow basic logic.</p><p>The Western IPR regime is a sphere of consensus that can not be changed
based on logic and reason alone.
Therefore, the scope and purpose of this book can not be limited to
logic and reason alone.</p><p>The consequences of the IPR Western ownership mistake are even more
grave than the previous Western ownership mistake — that of slavery
of Africans by Americans based on formal Western laws of ownership of
human beings. This time ramifications of the mistake are broader than
just America or the West, they put all of humanity in danger.</p><p>Ramifications and harm of the Western IPR regime are far broader than
they are generally understood. Western IPR regime indirectly impacts the 
individual’s autonomy and privacy and distorts the relationship between 
individuals and corporation.</p><p>In this document we address much of what surrounds IPR. Our goal is
to open the subject wide towards tangible results.</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">We introduce the concept of polyexistentials and based on that
we evaluate the validity of the Western IPR regime based on logic.

of Western IPR regime are invalid.</li><li class="li-enumerate">It is clear that polyexistentials should not be owned and it is
clear that the Western IPR regime should be abolished. But
abolishment of IPR regime should not lead to ungoverned
polyexistence. Polyexistentials should be regarded as “public
goods” and as such deserve legal protection because of negative
externalities which arise if polyexistentials are not properly
governed.<p>We frame the question of correct governance of
polyexistentials in their halaal and haraam manner-of-existence.</p></li><li class="li-enumerate">We then recognize digital as the most potent form of
polyexistentials and put forward concrete definitions for halaal
manner-of-existence of software and internet Services and label them
as Libre-Halaal.</li><li class="li-enumerate">In Part 2, we debunk common arguments in favor of validity of the

We recognize and illustrate that it is not reasonable to
expect that Americanist<a id="hevea_default28"></a>s could be awakened. This disease can not
be stopped in the West. Our hope is with the East.</li><li class="li-enumerate">In Part 3, Our focus then shifts towards solutions. We propose a number of
abstract cures towards replacing the current Western IPR traditions.</li><li class="li-enumerate">In Part 4, having confined ourselves with halaal

</p></li></ol><p>Each part of this document has a particular tone and a specific
style. The parts that introduce the concept and terminology of nature
of polyexistentials are scholarly, formal, logic based, and persuasion
oriented.</p><p>The parts that deal with exposure of the Western IPR regime
mistake are by choice inflammatory and aggressive. Our
philosophical analysis is that nature of polyexistentials leads
to the natural right to copy and the natural right to apply
knowledge without any monopoly oriented restrictions. This in
turn naturally leads to full rejection of the restrictive IPR
regime. The context of polyexistentials is inherently
universal. It is the responsibility of those who wish to
restrict our (humans) natural rights, to make a case for their
model. The burden of proof is on them not on us.</p><p>A meaningful case for IPR has never been made. So,
where appropriate we mock and we ridicule the Western status quo. We
frequently toy with the self-absorption and overly individualistic
aspects of Western cultures. Logic and persuasion alone are
ineffective against the entrenched Western IPR disease. Exposure of
the Western IPR regime mistake also involves the clarification that
IPR is a Western and mostly American mistake. As such our tone may
come across as anti-American and anti-Western. Western readers need to
recognize that the intended audience of this document is all of
humanity and that the scope of this topic is all of humanity. The
nature of this topic is inherently global.</p><p>The purpose and scope of this document is not limited to analysis of
Western IPR disease. We also offer theoretical recipes for cures.
The parts of this document that
deal with the cure, occasionally go beyond persuasion and are
prophetic. The cure part is broken into Western cures and Eastern
cures — each with their own flavor.</p><p>Content of this document reflects our independent thoughts. We
have not received any funding for producing this document.
We have not written this
document in the traditional context of Western IPR where the
result of our work are expected to bring economic rewards.
We have something to say and we want
others to read it and discuss it — towards the progress of
science and useful arts. Verbatim copying of this
polyexistential is unrestricted. We believe that the
collaborative model is the one which motivates real engineers,
real scientists and real artists.</p><p>We are law abiding citizens. We underscore the corrupt nature of
Western IPR regime, but we do not advocate illegal or
unauthorized copying in applicable territory. We advocate the
abolishment of Western IPR regime. In the mean time, we
encourage authors and inventors to subject their work to
non-restrictive copyright and no patents or non-restrictive
(defensive) patents in applicable territories. We advocate full
rejection of the Western IPR regime in territories where they may
be under consideration.</p><p>If there were to be any civil disobedience, we would follow
Martin Luter King’s model.</p><blockquote class="quote">
I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point
out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as
would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One
who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with
a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an
individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is
unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment
in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its
injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for
law.

<h2 id="sec12" class="section">2.7  You, Your Choices And Your Responsibility</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Our primary focus in this book is governance of
polyexistentials. Therefore, both the governed (polyexistentials)
and the governor (economic creatures vs humans) need to be subjects of
our analysis. In the context of governorship, 
throughout this book, in parallel with the model of polyexistence,
we draw a clear and explicit distinction between being an economic
creature and being a human. </p><p>In a sense then, you are part of the governorship. Governance of
polyexistentials by humans for humanity would be distinct and
different from governance of polyexistentials by economic creatures
for economic creatures. We have a choice. Ownership is a human construct.
We are in charge.</p><p>Americanism as a model for self-toxicated economic creature
existing in an industrial context has led to the creation of the
artificial-scarcities and artificial-competition oriented
environments that are rooted in the Western Intellectual Property
Rights regime. Humanism as a model for humans living in societies
leads to the natural collaboration oriented Libre-Halaal
polyexistential regime. Americanism vs Humanism lies at the
center of the conflict for governance of manner-of-existence of
polyexistentials.</p><p>Where do you fit in all of this? Are you a paticipant? Or are you just
an observer? Are you an “Intellectual Worker”? 
Do you “own” any patents or copyright?
Are you an economic creature or, are you a human?
Do you have any responsibilities in these regards?</p><p>By an “Intellectual Worker”, we are referring to those involved in 
production, organization and propagation of polyexistentials.
Professions related to: software, engineering, teaching, research,
arts, journalism, medicine, pharmacy, plant biology, etc. — all
involve production or propagation of polyexistentials. As a
medical doctor, when you prescribe patented medications, you are
propagating patents. As a software engineer working for the likes of
Microsoft, when you write code, you are producing copyrighted
material. Today, large parts of many societies are intellectual workers.
Enlarging of numbers of intellectual workers throughout the world is a 
clear trend.</p><p>It is very convenient for intelectuall workers to assume the validity
of IP and become accomplices. Status quo is often very profitable for
intelectuall workers. It may well not be in your economic interest to
understand or to advocate that the basic concept of Intellectual
Propoerty Rights is wrong.</p><p>If you are an intellectual worker, you are a participant. And if you
are not just an economic creature, as a human, you have
responsibilities.</p><p>Your responsibilities start by being willing to understand — even when
it may not be in your economic interest to understand.</p><p>It could well be the case that you, on your own, can not do much to 
impact the situation. But, collectively we can.</p>

<a id="chap:NatureOfPolyexistentials"></a>

</p><p>Here we categorize our world into two:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Monoexistentials
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Polyexistentials
</li></ol><p>There are things in nature that exist in singular and there are 
things that exist in multiples.</p><p>That which exists in nature in singular, we call
monoexistential. Examples of monoexistentials include:
tangible physical objects, a pencil, land, Internet domain
names, bandwidth. Chemistry and physics are the realm of monoexistentials.</p><p>That which exists in nature in multiples, we call
polyexistential. Examples of polyexistentials include:
knowledge, ideas, information, the digital entities.</p><p>This natural categorization then permits us to revisit the
question of ownership of polyexistentials which simply maps to
the Western Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Regime. The topics
of Western IPR and ownership and restriction of polyexistentials
are one and the same.</p><p>Our analysis is from the perspective of the possessed.
Traditional Western IPR analysis has always been from the
perspective of owner/creator/author.
The perspective of the possessed represents societal and human liberties.</p><p>This is the first introduction of the concept of
polyexistentials which leads to a different way of looking and
analyzing Western IPR regime. This duality of analysis based on
the perspective of author/owner vs. the perspective of
possessor/owned perspectives is similar to time domain analysis
vs frequency domain analysis or the dual nature of light as
particle or light as wave. They are different bases of analysis
for the same thing. Results of correct analysis in each domain
are equally valid and incorrect analysis in each domain are
equally invalid.</p><p>There is ample historic precedence for our approach. In the 13th
century Ibn-Sina<a id="hevea_default34"></a> «بو علی سینا» produced
“Daneshnamh Alaei” «دانشنامه علایی»,
[<a href="#daneshnameh"></a>], in which he classified his world. Based on
that classifications, he then used logic to conclude. Ibn-Sina<a id="hevea_default35"></a>’s
work became a basis for much of the Western scholarly
beginnings. In a sense, what we are doing here is extension of
that type of classification and logic for the digital era.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec15" Polyexistentials Reference Model-->
<h2 id="sec15" class="section">3.1  Polyexistentials Reference Model</h2><!--SEC END --><p>In this chapter we begin to develope a reference model. Let’s
call it the “Polyexistentials Reference Model”. Our goal is
to introduce a set of concepts and a terminology that can then be
used to evaluate merits of Western Intellectual Property laws and
to assist us to understand the proper governance model that is
needed for polyexistentials. The polyexistentials reference
model is independent and outside of the Western IP traditions.
This reference model is based on nature. It reflects science, not
beliefs, faith and opinions. This model is independent of
societal consensus and is equally valid in the East and the West.</p><p>We then put the Western IPR model against the polyexistentials
reference model and see that the two are in conflict. When
nature and man made conventions conflict, it is the man made
conventions that are wrong. The polyexistentials reference model
permit us to <span style="font-weight:bold">prove</span> that Western copyright and patent laws are
invalid as any form of property. Such a proof is then no longer
subject to any dispute because it is rooted in nature and logic
– not beliefs and opinions.</p><p>We then conclude that the Western
IPR model is erroneous. Based on that, we advocate that the
Western IPR model should be abolished.</p><p>Such analysis needs to start with clear categorization of
monoexistentials, polyexistentials and mixed-existentials.</p>

monoexistence is dominant.</p><p>Much of our world is actually a mixture of monoexistentials and
polyexistentials – mixed-existentials. In the case of
mixed-existentials, the dominant aspect of polyexistence or
monoexistence is sometimes clear. In such instances, we will refer to
the mixed-existentials based on its dominant aspect. </p><p>Consider a book. A traditional book is mixed-existential. The paper and the ink
are monoexistentials. 
But the content of the book (its information)
is polyexistential. 
In the case of a book, clearly the dominant
aspect is usually (not always) polyexistential. When you read a
book, you are reading its content.
A book can easily be digitized, in which case it
becomes a pure polyexistential.
But, if the book was a rare historic manuscript, then the 
dominant aspect could have been its monoexistential dimension.</p><p>In the case of a given factory generated spoon,
the dominant aspect is usually the material spoon which is
monoexistential and not polyexistential instructions supplied to the
numerically controlled machine that produced that particular spoon.</p>

existence of elements in nature prior to having discovered them.</p><p>Mendeleev used the patterns in his table to predict the
properties of the elements he thought must exist but had yet to
be discovered. He left blank spaces in his chart as placeholders
to represent those unknown elements. The four predicted elements
lighter than the rare-earth elements, eka-boron (Eb, under boron,
B, 5), eka-aluminium (Ea or El,[2] under Al, 13), eka-manganese
(Em, under Mn, 25), and eka-silicon (Es, under Si, 14), proved to
be good predictors of the properties of scandium (Sc, 21),
gallium (Ga, 31), technetium (Tc, 43), and germanium (Ge, 32)
respectively, each of which fill the spot in the periodic table
assigned by Mendeleev.</p><p>Monoexistence of those undiscovered elements was independent of us.

The manufacturing process is a polyexistential but what gets produced 
can have a dominant monoexistential characteristic. When mass produced, each is monoexistential.</p><p>If the manufacturing process is relatively simple (say cutting of
a tree), then we would consider the result of the manufacturing
process monoexistential because the polyexistential component
of the end result is insignificant.</p><p>If the manufacturing process is complex (say building a gun) then
we would consider the result of the manufacturing process a

concept of Non-Rivalry<a id="hevea_default40"></a> Goods is an economic term. Basing economics as
the primary basis for structuring human laws is wrong. Inclusion of
IPR in the US constitution by businessmen (so-called founding fathers
of America) is another example of the confusion which amounts to an
attempt in creating rivalry goods from polyexistentials – based on artificial scarcity.</p><p>Goods that are both non-rival and non-excludable are called “public
goods.” It is generally accepted by mainstream economists that the
market mechanism will under-provide public goods, so these goods have
to be produced by other means, including government provision.
Polyexistentials are inherently public goods.</p><p>The Western IPR regime is the opposite of “Public Goods”. In the US

polyexistentials come from the impact that they can have on
human condition.</p><p>Polyexistentials can be re-instantiated. Two copies of the Expressed Formula
are two instances of the same formula.
The mechanism that surround storage of the pure polyexistentials
(e.g.; brain (human’s or animal’s), paper, digital memory) can
facilitate copying, transmission and dissemination of the pure
polyexistentials to varying degrees. The digital form in particular
makes copying, transmission and dissemination of pure polyexistential
extremely practical and as such the digital era has made understanding
the nature of polyexistentials most critical.</p><p>Unlike monoexistentials, polyexistentials are not bound by
location. At any given time multiple instances of the same
polyexistential could be in different places. Unlike
monoexistentials, polyexistentials can be transmitted or
broadcasted over distances at the maximum theoretical speed of
light. The digital form of polyexistentials permits for
error-free and exact transmission and error-free and exact
copying of polyexistentials. This ability to make exact
transmission and exact copying of polyexistentials is a new
human capability that occured in 20th centure. It is this new
capability that has made the need for a polyexistential
reference model more acute.</p><p>Expressed Formula is either for human consumption (idea,
knowledge, software source code) or for machine consumption
(binary software, paper tape for NC machines, Music CDs). When
Expressed Formula is for machine consumption we call it a program
or software. Machines consume the binary form of software. Humans
produce the source form of software. When the source form is
publicly available, it is called open-source software. When the
source form is only privately available, it is called
closed-source software. With open-source software, the software
engineering profession can know what the software does and can
inform the public of potential harm. With closed-source software,
we simply can’t know exactly what the software does. The Western
IPR regime slants availability of software towards being
closed-source and proprietary. The Libre-Halaal model slants
availability of software towards being open-source and a public
asset.</p><p>Propagation, replication, copying of polyexistentials is as simple as
memory transfer. Restricting propagation of
polyexistentials is counter to nature.
New existence (instantiations) of polyexistentials have no impact on 
previous existence.
Additional existence of polyexistentials can make them 
more useful. 
Monopolistic ownership oriented restriction of
polyexistentials is counter to nature and creates harmful artificial
scarcities.
Monopolistic ownership oriented restriction of polyexistentials is morally wrong and should be
abolished.
Attribution of Expressed Formula to its producer is called
for. </p><p>For monoexistentials
possession and ownership is one-to-one. 
For polyexistentials,
possession is many-to-many and therfore ownership is not possible.</p>

polyexistentials can not be owned. Western IP laws are about

such Western IP laws are erroneous laws. They are erroneous
because multiple possessions of a polyexistential does not lead
to conflict and because they are counter to the nature of
polyexistentials.</p><p>Proper ownership laws should not result in restricting general
liberty. Ownership of a monoexistential restricts actions of
only those who wish to interact with that particular
monoexistential (a unique instance). Ownership of a

of a mixed-existential put blanket restrictions on liberty of all
those who wish to interact with any instance (all instances) of

Natural scarcity is that which follows from the relationship

</p><p>This overview of copyright law has been compiled from various online resources.</p><p>Copyright are public restrictions on verbatim (or close to verbatim)
copying and partial copying of many types of polyexistentials
including, books and code (software).</p><p>Copyright believers claim that one of the most visible rights
that the author of a work has, is the copyright over his work. In
the Western model, almost everything that is published, whether
eletronically or not, is copyrighted. In general, a work is
copyrighted when it is created, and it is not necessary to apply
for copyright. Some countries may, however, give extra protection
to works that are registered. In any case, when a work is
copyrighted, others may not use or redistribute the work without
the permission of the author.</p><p>Copyrights are considered "territorial rights", which means that
they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific
jurisdiction. While many aspects of national copyright laws have
been standardized through international copyright agreements,
copyright laws vary by country.</p><p>In the U.S.A., copyright is a right given to authors of “original
works,” such as books, articles, movies, and computer
programs. Copyright gives the exclusive right to reproduce the
work, prepare derivative works, or to perform or present the work
publicly. Copyrights protect only the form or expression of
ideas, not the underlying ideas themselves. While a copyright
may be registered to obtain legal advantages, a copyright need
not be registered to exist. Rather, a copyright comes into
existence automatically the moment the work is “fixed” in a
“tangible medium of expression,” and lasts for the life of the
author plus seventy years, or for a total of ninety-five years in
cases in which the employer owns the copyright.</p>

</p><p>Copyright law is a form of monopolistic ownership oriented
polyexistential restriction.</p><p>Under Western copyright laws, the creator of a given
polyexistential (the copyrighted polyexistential) is granted a
monopolistic ownership oriented restriction privilege that
enables the grantee (copyright holder) to restrict all others
within the jurisdiction of copyright law from copying the polyexistential or any
mixed-existential whose polyexistential component is the
copyrighted polyexistential.</p>

<a id="sec:AboutPatentLaw"></a>
</p><p>Patents are monopolistic ownership oriented laws which
restrict the public on application of knowledge (polyexistentials).</p><p>A patent is the exclusive right to make, use or sell an invention
in a country. In order to get this right, the inventor must apply
for a patent at his patent office. Patents provide very powerful
legal remedies against infringers, even against infringes who
have developed the same invention completely independently.</p><p>A patent effectively grants
the inventor a limited monopoly on the manufacture, use,
or sale of the invention. However, a patent actually only
grants to the patentee the right to exclude (i.e., to prevent
others from practicing the patented invention); it does not
actually grant to the patentee the right to use the patented
invention.</p><p>In the U.S. not every innovation or discovery is
patentable. Three categories of subject matter that are
unpatentable are: “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and
abstract ideas.” Reducing abstract ideas to some type of
“practical application,” i.e., “a useful, concrete and tangible
result,” is patentable, however. U.S. patents, last from the
date of issuance until twenty years from the original filing date
of the patent application.</p><p>Most countries have a “first-to-file” system for priority. The
U.S. system is a “first-to-invent” system.</p><p>Under the Western World Trade Organization’s (WTO) TRIPS Agreement,
patents should be available in WTO member states for any
invention, in all fields of technology, provided they are new,
involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial
application. Nevertheless, there are variations on what is
patentable subject matter from country to country, even among WTO
member states. TRIPS also provides that the term of protection
available should be a minimum of twenty years.</p><!--TOC subsection id="sec57" Mapping Of Patent Law To Polyexistentials-->

</p><p>Western patent law assigns a given entity monopolistic ownership
oriented rights to restrict all others (the public) from
incorporating a given polyexistential (subject of the patent) in
any mixed-existential whose polyexistential is the subject of
the patent.</p><p>In the context of the patent laws, the restricted polyexistential is
knowledge. The patent law then restricts the public
to apply their own knowledge to their own monoexistential to become 
the substrate of mixed-existentials that they desire to create.</p><p>In the example of the hypothetical gun, the real owner of the
hypothetical raw-material looses its real ownership rights over
his/her hypothetical raw-material when he/she wants to mix it
with the monopolistic polyexistential restrictions – even when
the existence of such restrictions in not known to him/her.</p><p>In the case of patents, monopolistic polyexistential restrictions

</p><p>Trademarks are public restrictions on labeling and use of labels.</p><p>A trademark is, broadly speaking, any mark that is used for indicating
goods or services in commerce. Normally trademarks are words or an
image (a logo), although occasionally colors or sounds can also be
trademarks. Usually, it is necessary to register the mark with a local
trademark office before it gains protection under trademark law. A
trademark holder can forbid others from offering particular goods or
services using the trademark or a confusingly similar sign. It is also
often possible to act against use of the trademark which dilutes its
reputation.</p>

restrictions on names, symbols, marks and lables.</p><p>Trademark laws are not as problematic as copyright and patent.
But, they are unnecessary. What they set to accomplish, can be
accomplished by other means – particularly in this day and age.</p><p>Kinsella, in [<a href="#IPR-StephanKinsell"></a>], puts it this way:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Suppose some Lachmannian changes the name on his failing
hamburger chain from LachmannBurgers to Rothbard Burgers, which
is already the name of another hamburger chain. I, as a consumer,
am hungry for a RothbardBurger. I see one of the fake
RothbardBurger joints run by the stealthy Lachmannian, and I buy
a burger. Under current law, Rothbard, the “owner” of the
RothbardBurgers trademark, can prevent the Lachmannian from using
the mark RothbardBurgers to sell burgers because it is
“confusingly similar” to his own trademark. That is, it is likely
to mislead consumers as to the true source of the goods
purchased. The law, then, gives a right to the trademark holder
against the trademark infringer. <p>In my view, it is the consumers
whose rights are violated, not the trademark holder’s. In the
foregoing example, I (the consumer) thought I was buying a
RothbardBurger, but instead got a crummy LachmannBurger with its
weird kaleidoscopic sauce. I should have a right to sue the
Lachmannian for fraud and breach of contract (not to mention
intentional infliction of emotional distress and
misrepresentation of praxeological truths). However, it is
difficult to see how this act of fraud, perpetrated by the
Lachmannian on me, violates Rothbard’s rights. The Lachmannian’s
actions do not physically invade Rothbard’s property. He does
not even convince others to do this; at most, he may be said to
convince third parties to take an action within their rights,
namely, to buy a burger from the Lachmannian instead of
Rothbard.

others by which a business can obtain an economic advantage over

contractually obligate his purchasers not to copy the

not in privity with the contractual obligor and obligee, are not
bound by the contractual relationship. </p><p>For this reason, although a creator of a polyexistential (say an

<a id="sec:FraudulenceOfTheWesternIPRRegime"></a>
</p><p>The polyexistential reference model that we presented in 
this section makes it clear that:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
The subject of patent, copyright and trademark are polyexistentials.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Polyexistentials are multi-possessable and therefore unownable.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Polyexistentials are inherently non-scarce and therefore unownable.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Polyexistentials are inherently not-territorial and therefore unownable.
</li></ol><p>Mono-possession and scarcity are fundamental requirements for
property and ownership.
The underlying subjects of patent, copyright and trademark are
polyexistentials. That which is to be patented, copyrighted and
trademarked are unownable and therefore can not be considered
property of any sort.</p><p>Ownership of polyexistentials in the form of monopolized
restriction of polyexistentials and their consideration as any
from of property is erroneous and counter to nature.</p><p>Therefore, patent, copyright and trademark individually and under
the collective label of Intellectual Property are fraudulent. The
fraud is that of applying property and ownership to
polyexistentials which are inherently not ownable.</p><p>Having established that patent, copyright and trademark are not
any form of property, we now consider them as societal regulations.</p><p>Patent, copyright and trademark in general and patent and
copyright in particular are local laws that result in grants of
monopoly privileges for restriction of polyexistentials.</p><p>These restrictions result in scarcity of polyexistentials which
are otherwise inherently non-scarce. Patent, copyright and
trademark are local laws that result in creation of artificial
scarcity.</p><p>The purpose of patent and copyright laws in creating artificial
scarcity is towards the goal of “promoting the progress of
science and useful arts” by providing exclusive rights to
creators. This amounts to the assumption that by making a
particular useful polyexistential scarce it is possible to
create an unnatural environment that is superior for creation of
more useful polyexistentials. This in turn is based on the
assumption that a forced competitive model is superior to the
natural collaborative model for progressing science and useful
arts. Both of these assumptions were unproven at the time that
patent and copyright laws were instituted. We now know that both
of these assumptions are wrong.</p><p>It is impossible to “prove” a negative – that IP does not have
the direct positive economic and innovative effect often claimed.
But there is also no conclusive evidence that Western patent and
copyright laws have had the direct economic effect often claimed.
There is also no conclusive evidence that patent and copyright
laws increase incentives for innovation. There are many
indications that patent and copyright laws hamper innovation.</p>

<a id="sec:RamificationsOfTheWesternIPRFraud"></a>
</p><p>After more than 200 years of being in practice in the West, there
is no empirical evidence that confirm success of Western IPR in
accomplishing its intended goal. However, the harm of Western IPR
in the form of restricting natural rights of others is concrete
and evident.</p><p>Patent and copyright laws are hostile to liberty. Patent and
copyright monopolies interfere with the freedom of others. They
prevent others to use their own knowledge, their own bodies and
their own justly acquired monoexistential properties as they
relate to the specific polyexistentials that patent and
copyright restrict. Secondary effects of patent and copyright laws
result in reduction of autonomy and privacy of individuals.</p><p>Grants of patent and copyright monopoly in the wealth
maximization utilitarian model end up damaging market
foundations. Creation of artificial scarcity for
polyexistentials towards mimicking the market process governing
monoexistentials results in weakening ownership of
monoexistentials. The very same legal foundation from which
markets begin.</p><p>Patent and copyright laws are in conflict with nature, They do
not serve the ideal intended purpose of societal regulations,
i.e. to balance rights equitably among conflicting
constituencies. On the contrary, it has the effect of enriching a
minority of powerful vested interests, to the very great
detriment of society at large. The detrimental effects include
the obstruction of engineering creativity, a distortion of the
competitive business environment, and denial of the benefits
thereof to the public.</p><p>In practice, natural dynamics of Western IP restrictions result in
transfer of power and autonomy away from individuals and to
corporations and Corpocracy.</p><p>Patent and copyright are laws that have severe harmful
ramifications which are not generally understood. In the context
of software and internet (digitals – pure polyexistentials),
Western patent and copyright laws have directed
manner-of-existence of software and internet services to become
internally opaque. As a result we don’t usually know what the
software or internet service that we are using is doing. This in
turn has been eroding our autonomy and privacy. And that trend is
continuing.</p><p>The natural global and universal nature of polyexistentials has
required the Western IPR regime pushers to present patent and
copyright laws as universal and global. In other words a local
ownership mistake is well on its way to becoming a global
ownership mistake.</p><p>The Western so-called Intelectual Propoerty Rights regime has put
humanity in danger.</p>

creating a programming language that would produce binaries that
would execute on many computers through the use of a Compiler.
Fortran was primarily discipline specific. It was for
scientific computations.</p><p>The most significant event in history of programming languages is
Lisp. Lisp raised programming from the machine domain to human
domain. Abstractions of Lisp were no longer computer centric,
they were consistent symbols which a programmer could tailor to
her subject domain. Lisp is in common use today. In it early days
it did not have all needed capabilities but its structure
supported the evolution.</p><p>Alan Kay has famously described Lisp as the “Maxwell’s equations
of software”. The universality of syntax of Lisp make it unique
in ways that is absent on other programming languages. Lisp is
homoiconic. It treats code as data. This means that it is able to
create domain specifc structures (through a powerful macro
system) and become very extensible.</p><p>Over the years software engineers have come up with a number of
programming languages which emphasize various desired
characteristics (efficiency, object orientation, robustness, ease
of use, etc.) These have formed families of programming languages
which are depicted in
Figure <a href="#fig%3Ahistory-of-high-level-programming-languages-evolution-form-1954-2002">4.3</a>.</p><p>From the perspective of polyexistence, What is of significance
for us is manner-of-existence of software. Software has two
forms, binary and source. The binary form of software is for
execution by computers. The source form of software is for use by
humans — software engineers.</p><p>Based on societal laws, for general use, software can be
available in binary form only. Or, software can be available in
source form and its resulting binary form. When software is
available in source form, based on societal regulations
modification and distribution of software can be limited. These
types of limitations and permissions define manner-of-existence
of software.</p><p>Through the Western IPR regime, Microsoft Windows is available in
binary form only. This has immense ramifications on health of
society which impact the autonomy and privacy of individuals.</p><p>Refering to
Figure <a href="#fig%3Ahistory-of-high-level-programming-languages-evolution-form-1954-2002">4.3</a>,
We note that in the early days, There were few computers, and
most software was custom-developed for in-house applications. At
that time, the source code for programs were regarded as part of
computer and were available with the computer. It wasn’t until
the early 1960s that computer programs were being actively
marketed by a software industry besides the computer
manufacturers. Before widely-marketed software, it was easy to
protect by a contract or license agreement any computer program
that was being marketed. While a contract restricted what people
receiving the software could do with it, particularly limiting
their further distribution of the software, it could not bind
people who were not parties to the contract. A person finding a
computer program on the street could do anything he or she wanted
with it. Copyright law, on the other hand, provides protection
for a computer program even when no contract exists.<sup><a id="text4" href="#note4">1</a></sup></p><p>In the United States the Copyright Act of 1976, which became
effective on January 1, 1978, made it clear that Congress
intended software to be copyrightable.</p><p>Also, note the number and the types of users of computer programs
changed significantly. In the early days of computer programs,
both developers and users were typically engineers and
scientists. It was not until the early 1980s that Personal
Computers (PCs) appeared. In the early days of computer programs
it was meaningful to wish for users of software to have the
freedom to modify their software. Today, the freedom of users to
modify their software is largely theoretical. It is only through
the software engineering profession that software in source form
has practical significance.</p>

software and delivery of the results of that execution. With internet
application services, the user has no access to the software that
is being executed so the manner-of-existence of software of
internet application services is unknown — it is opaque.</p><p>To make the manner-of-existence of internet application services
tangible, it is necessary to regulate internet application
service providers. For example, for some types of internet
application services, the service provider may be required to
make the service transparent by publishing the entirety of the
software of the service and allow users to self-host the service
if they wish. Such manner-of-existence of internet application
services would then be different from manner-of-existence of
unregulated internet application services.</p>

<!--TOC chapter id="sec75" Proper Governance Of Polyexistentials-->
<h1 id="sec75" class="chapter">Chapter 5  Proper Governance Of Polyexistentials:<br>
Halaal And Haraam Manner Of Polyexistence</h1><!--SEC END --><p>
<a id="chap:ProperGovernanceOfPolyexistentials"></a>

</p><p>Our analysis in the previous chapters makes it clear that
polyexistential should not be owned (subjected to monopolistic
restrictions). We have demonstrated that monopolistic ownership
oriented restriction of polyexistentials is wrong.</p><p>With the question of ownership of polyexistentials aside, we now
focus on the question of proper governance of polyexistentials.</p><p>Polyexistentials should be regarded as “public goods” and as
such deserve legal protection because of negative externalities
which arise if polyexistentials are not properly governed.</p><p>One of our challenges here is that of terminology. The concepts
of “public goods”, “commons”, “targedy of the commons”, etc
are all rooted in the realm of monoexistentials but have
occasionally been extended to polyexistentials without the
needed recognitions. Hence, use of the existing terminology for
analysis of proper governance of polyexistentials 
rapidly becomes disorderly.</p><p>The types of needed legal protections are dependent on the type
of polyexistentials and are to be rooted in the health of
professions that correspond to the polyexistential. All of this
is to be towards health of society and humanity.</p><p>The most basic needed legal protections of polyexistentials is
for their manner-of-existence. Because manner-of-existence of
polyexistentials is inherently universal and global, it is this
most basic aspect of polyexistentials that should eventually be
subjected to global governance (legal protections).</p><p>Hence, we set the stage for moving towards global definitions and
labellings of halaal (ethically correct) manner-of-existence of
polyexistentials.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec76" Manner-Of-Existence Of Polyexistentials-->
<h2 id="sec76" class="section">5.1  Manner-Of-Existence Of Polyexistentials</h2><!--SEC END --><p>There are three fundamental aspects to polyexistentials:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Manner-of-existence of Polyexistentials
</li><li class="li-itemize">Capabilities (functionality) of Polyexistentials
</li><li class="li-itemize">Usage of Polyexistentials
</li></ul><p>By polyexistential capabilities,
we mean what the polyexistential is built to accomplish, for good or ill. 
Examples of software polyexistential
built for ill might be spying, tracking, invasion of privacy. </p><p>By polyexistential usage, we mean how the polyexistential is used,
regardless of its intended purpose. For example a video player
software could be used to watch news or to watch porn.</p><p>Regarding the functionality and usage of software and Internet
services, a sovereign state can and should exercise its own moral
sovereignty and define halaal on its own terms. And so praise and
applause to the great firewall of China, and the great firewall of
Iran. Clearly, Las Vegas porn should stay in Las Vegas and should
remain haraam in Ghom<a id="hevea_default49"></a>.</p><p>Consideration of what constitutes right and wrong with regard to
capabilities and usage is primarily the domain of ethicists. And
these rights and wrongs need not be global in scope.</p><p>But in contrast to functionality and usage, the definition of
halaal manner of existence of polyexistentials in general and
software and internet services in particular are best dealt with
in the global context.</p><p>The topic of this section is <em>manner-of-existence</em> of
polyexistentials. By “manner-of-existence” of
polyexistentials we mean everything relating to how the
polyexistential exists within society. This includes but is not
limited to:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Is possession of the polyexistentials restricted by local law?
</li><li class="li-itemize">Is possession of the polyexistentials restricted by other methods?
</li><li class="li-itemize">Is the polyexistentials assigned to an owner?
</li><li class="li-itemize">Is the polyexistentials attributed to its true author?
</li><li class="li-itemize">Is copying the polyexistentials restricted by local law?
</li><li class="li-itemize">Is copying the polyexistentials restricted by other methods?
</li><li class="li-itemize">Is use of the polyexistentials restricted by local law?
</li><li class="li-itemize">Is use of the polyexistentials restricted by other methods?
</li><li class="li-itemize">Is the polyexistentials internally transparent?
</li><li class="li-itemize">Is the polyexistentials modifiable and enhanceable?
</li></ul><p>Global or societal rule governing manner-of-existence polyexistentials can be 
broadly categorized into the following three:</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Proprietary (owned) and monopolistically restricted manner-of-existence of Polyexistentials:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> 
This is exemplified by the Western IPR Regime.</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Law Less Polyexistentials:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> Many societies allow governance of
polyexistentials to be purely based on the nature of
polyexistentials and have no laws governing manner-of-existence of 
polyexistentials.</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Halaal manner-of-existence Polyexistentials:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> Where for each
form of polyexistentials a set of requirements for the “right”
manner-of-existence of the polyexistential is recognized.
By “right” here we really mean “halaal”.</dd></dl>

map to “right.” And, philosophical haraam is “manifestation” of
“moral sensibilities” relevant to a specific topic where “the set of

<h3 id="sec78" class="subsection">5.2.1  Uses Of Halaal As A Label</h3><!--SEC END --><p>In the context of polyexistence, the primary question then becomes:
What is the “right” manner-of-existence of a polyexistential? But
then, what do we mean by “right”? Are “moral” or “ethical”
better words for the label that we need. Unfortunately English
does not have the right word for the label that is needed here.</p><p>“Halaal” is the right word and label that we are looking for.</p><p>What makes for Halaal or Haraam manner-of-existence of
polyexistentials directly affects and involves professions.</p><p>We put forward that for each form of polyexistential, the manner-of-existence that permit
professions to safeguard society and humanity are the halaal manner-of-existence for that
polyexistential.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec79" The Libre-Halaal Label-->
<h3 id="sec79" class="subsection">5.2.2  The Libre-Halaal Label</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
<a id="sec:TheLibre-HalaalLabel"></a>
</p><p>As a title for halaal manner-of-existence of polyexistentials we
introduce the “Libre-Halaal” label.</p><p>In the “Libre-Halaal” label, 
Libre indicates that:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
The scope of consideration of Halaal is manner-of-existence of polyexistentials.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">We reject the Western IPR regime. That the natural right to copy

</li></ol><p>In the “Libre-Halaal” label,

We are rooted in philosophy, ethics and morality — Not just economics.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">For each form of polyexistential, the manner-of-existence that permit

halaal manner-of-existence for that polyexistential.<p>There are two reasons for this:
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
A: Professions have responsibility to society.
</li><li class="li-itemize">B: When polyexistentials are man made tools,
the halaalness requirement should empower conviviality of tools.
</li></ul></li></ol><p>By conviviality we refer to the concept of 
“Tools for Conviviality” as Ivan Illich<a id="hevea_default50"></a>
introduced it. </p><p>In the document titled:</p><blockquote class="quote">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Introducing Convivial Into Globish</span><br>
<a href="http://mohsen.banan.1.byname.net/PLPC/120037">http://mohsen.banan.1.byname.net/PLPC/120037</a>
</blockquote><p>we introduce the term "Convivial" into Globish.</p><p>Briefly, in Illich’s words:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Tools are intrinsic to social relationships. An individual relates
himself in action to his society through the use of tools that he
actively masters, or by which he is passively acted upon.<p>To the degree that he masters his tools, he can invest the world
with his meaning; to the degree that he is mastered by his tools,
the shape of the tool determines his own self-image. Convivial
tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest
opportunity to enrich the environment with the fruits of his or
her vision. Industrial tools deny this possibility to those who
use them and they allow their designers to determine the meaning
and expectations of others. Most tools today cannot be used in a
convivial fashion.
</p></blockquote><p>The dynamics of the Western IPR regime are such
that they produce industrial tools.</p><p>In a sense, tools are extension of human behavior.</p><p>Conviviality of tools involves their manner-of-existence, capabilities
of the tools, their broader environment and their usage context.
The dimension of manner-of-existence of polyexistential tools (their
Libre-Halaalness) is necessary but not sufficient to make the tools 
convivial.</p><p>In the context of our own profession (software and internet
engineering), we build on this and provide definitional criteria
for Libre-Halaal Software and Libre-Halaal Internet Services.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec80" Ramifications Of Manner-Of-Existence Of Polyexistentials On Professions-->
<h2 id="sec80" class="section">5.3  Ramifications Of Manner-Of-Existence Of Polyexistentials On Professions</h2><!--SEC END --><p>We put our finger on Western IPR Regime and label it a central sin of our time because
it impacts many professions and many aspects of life. Western IPR regime is the source of
much that becomes haraam.</p><p>Each profession has a responsibility to society and humanity towards
protecting a certain aspect of life. In order to fulfill these
responsibilities, professions need and require certain moral
understandings and agreements from society.</p><p>Here we are using the term “profession” in the way it is understood in the East.</p><p>The notion of a “profession” in the West consists of training and the acquisition of
specialized skills, to perform specialized work, to create monetary income. The
responsibility of a profession towards society at large does not factor significantly in
this. Western society is mostly, if not totally, economically driven. The Western model of
economically driven individuals existing within an industrial context considers only money
and self-interest. Such broader concepts as society, profession, responsibility and
respect are very weak in the Western model.</p><p>In the East the word “profession” carries a greater meaning. It
includes the Western meaning of a specialized skill set to perform
work of value to others. But it also includes an agenda of trust and
responsibility. The professional person is entrusted by society to
maintain guardianship over an important aspect of life. Based on
proper execution of this responsibility, the profession is respected.</p><p>The primary author of this essay, attests that:
for him as an engineer it is only in Iran that he is called “Mr. Engineer Banan<a id="hevea_default51"></a>.” That has
never happened to him in America, Canada, England, France, or anywhere else in his travels
throughout the Western world.</p><p>So it is in this Eastern sense that we are here speaking of “professional
responsibility.”</p><p>Today, professions know less borders. And these certain moral understandings need to now
be certain global moral understandings and agreements from humanity. Such global moral
agreements can well take the form of halaal and haraam declarations.</p><p>Subject-matter knowledge and application of subject-matter knowledge is at the core of
professions. The profession’s subject-matter knowledge is often tied to something that is
a basic societal need. Farmers and Food, Doctors and Medication, Software-Engineers and
Software are some examples. Restriction of knowledge and restriction of application of
knowledge through patents amounts to crippling of professions. That crippling of
professions in turn makes the manner-of-existence of the thing that the profession is
responsible for, a haraam manner-of-existence.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec81" Role of Professions in Declaring Halaal and Haraam-->
<h3 id="sec81" class="subsection">5.3.1  Role of Professions in Declaring Halaal and Haraam</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The rapid pace of technology has created an environment where the need for halaal/haraam
declarations is more urgent.</p><p>Because the profession is often closest to the source of the harm and because the
profession is sometimes best positioned to understand the harm, the profession should
sometimes blow the whistle before the ethicists, theologians, philosophers, sociologists and
legislators get to it.
Often, by the time that the legislators get to it, it is too late.</p><p>The halaal manner-of-existence of
what is at the base and core of a profession therefore needs protection. For example:</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Halaal Manner Of Existence Of Medication</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> is fundamental to the profession of Medicine.

</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Halaal Manner Of Existence Of Digitals</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> is fundamental to the profession of Software Engineering.
</dd></dl><p>Here we briefly consider, “Medicine and Doctors”, “Food and
Farmers” and “Knowledge and Academics” as three examples. We
then focus on our own profession (Software Engineering) to move
towards defining halaal-manner-of-existence of software and
internet services.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec82" Medication and Doctors-->
<h4 id="sec82" class="subsubsection">Medication and Doctors</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The fact that patented medication in the West restricts healing has ramifications for the
profession of medicine in Brazil, in Iran, in China and everywhere. In the Western patent
model, the knowledge of the cure for an illness is at hand, but applying that knowledge to
produce the medication is restricted by the patent regime and the businessman who holds
that patent (a monopoly). And the patient has to suffer and perhaps die, unless he is rich
enough and he conforms to the Western so-called Intellectual Property Rights economic
regime that demands payment to the patent holder who is in control of his cure. In many
cases, the cost of a patented medication is almost entirely the cost of the patent. The
cost of the ingredients and the cost of making the drug are often a very small fraction of
what the patent holder demands for the patent.</p><p>In America, the profession of medicine has fully failed society. The American doctor has
become quite comfortable being an economic creature existing in an industrial context. The
“Patient” has become the “Client”. The American “Doctor” has become the “Service
Provider”. And in that “Client”–”Provider” model, the services and goods being
exchanged for money is called “Health Care”. In that model, of course there is no place
for respect that Society owes its Doctors.</p><p>The nature of the profession of medicine is unique and making it be subservient to the
economic model damages society and endangers humanity. In America the profession of
medicine is fully subservient to economics. This is fully manifest in an exceptionally
American phenomena: Prescription Drug Advertising. On national TV, the holder of patents
for prescription drugs directly advertises to the public the availability of their goods.
The business-man dangles the cure in front of the patient and tells the
customer to demand that good from his service provider. That much for the end of the
Doctor-Patient relationship! The ugliness of this inhumanity goes straight over the heads
of American individualistic economic creatures.</p><p>The profession of medicine and Doctors everywhere should do what the American service
provider does not comprehend: start with demanding that society, government and moral
leaders declare:
</p><blockquote class="quote">
Patents for Medications are Haraam.
</blockquote><p>It is only after the powerful patent based pharmaceutical industry is contained, that 
Medicine may have a chance to be a profession.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec83" Food and Farmers-->
<h4 id="sec83" class="subsubsection">Food and Farmers</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The fact that American agro-business has terminated the American farmer (see Food Inc<a id="hevea_default52"></a>., [<a href="#FoodInc"></a>].)
has ramifications for the Brazilian, Iranian and Chinese farmers. A main instrument of
American agro-business in terminating the American farmer were patented chemicals and
patented organisms. Separate from the American economic model, Brazilian, Iranian and
Chinese farmers should put on the table the question of what makes for global halaal
agriculture and what makes for global halaal food. Are patented GMOs (Genetically Modified
Organisms) haraam? Is patented food haraam?</p><p>Farmers everywhere should do what the American farmer
failed to do: demand that society, government and moral
leaders declare:
</p><blockquote class="quote">
Patents for Food are Haraam.
</blockquote>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec84" Knowledge And Academics-->
<h4 id="sec84" class="subsubsection">Knowledge And Academics</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Academics play an important role in the well being of the society. Their role falls into
two broad categories:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Teaching – dissemination of knowledge
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Research – discovery and production of knowledge
</li></ol><p>Teaching prospers when copying is not restricted by the Western copyright regime.</p><p>Research prospers when application of knowledge is not restricted by the Western patent
regime.</p><p>The existence of the patent and copyright debate may be understandable in the industry but not in academia.
Pursuit of knowledge is in conflict with ownership of knowledge.
Being in favor of patents and participating in IPR regime is in conflict with being an academic. </p><p>Yet, American Academia loves copyright and patents. There is no shortage of so-called
American teachers that compete in producing copyright restricted text books and lecture
notes. There is no shortage of so-called American researchers that keeps restricting
application of knowledge with patents.</p><p>David Graeber, In
“The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy”, captures the evolution of the “Academics” succinctly:</p><blockquote class="quote">
“There was a time when academia was society’s refuge for the
eccentric, brilliant, and impractical. No longer. It is now the domain
of professional self-marketers. As for the eccentric, brilliant, and
impractical: it would seem society now has no place for them at all.”
</blockquote><p>Copyright and patents are tools of self-marketers.
The process that has made the American economic model the American societal model has corrupted both teaching and research. </p><p>Academics everywhere should do what the American academic has
failed to do: demand that society, government and moral
leaders declare:

life, globally. This demands a common set of understandings and
agreements regarding their manner of existence.
</p><p>Regarding the functionality and usage of software and Internet
services, a sovereign state can and should exercise its own moral
sovereignty and define halaal on its own terms. And so praise and

and autonomy and privacy of the individual.</p><p>Today there are two models for the manner-of-existence of software.</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
The Proprietary Software Model.<p>This model is exemplified by Microsoft Windows. It is based on a
competitive development model, and dominated by American
companies. It is protected and rooted in the corrupt Western
so-called Intellectual Property Rights regime, in particular the
twin ownership mechanisms of patent and copyright. It is opaque
and prevents software users from knowing what their software is doing.
Therefore, the user can not trust the software.
Its distribution is controlled by its producer.</p></li><li class="li-enumerate">The Non-Proprietary Software Model.<p>This model is exemplified by Debian GNU/Linux. It is based on a
collaborative development model where software engineers worldwide
work collectively to move the software forward. It rejects the
corrupt Western so-called Intellectual Property Rights regime of
patent and copyright. It is internally transparent and permits
the Software Engineering profession to verify the software.
Therefore, the user can trust the software.
Its distribution is unrestricted.</p></li></ol><p>Though it is not part of popular cultural awareness, there is
currently a titanic battle taking place between these two competing
ideologies.
This is a to-the-death battle,
from which there can eventually emerge only a single winner.</p><p>The software battle is part of a broader ideological contest, about
ownership models for
<a href="http://www.by-star.net/PLPC/120033">polyexistentials in
general</a> (software, but also including literature, music, images,
movies, etc.) in the digital era.</p><p>The result of this battle has broader
ramifications for individuals and society – which impact autonomy,
privacy, freedom, and social interaction.
The model that any given society chooses for the manner-of-existence of software (and more
broadly digital constructs and polyexistentials) impacts social and societal behaviors
and shapes what people become.</p><p>The scope of usage of the “Libre-Halaal” label is the entirety of the domain of
polyexistentials. The digital domain as a form of polyexistentials is of particular
interest to us as software engineers.</p><p>Libre-Halaal Software in particular is of importance in that software is controller of all
that is digital. Key attributes of Libre-Halaal Software are that its usage and copying
are unrestricted and it is perpetually internally transparent and modifiable.</p><p>We want to move towards defining the halaal manner-of-existence of Software and the halaal
manner-of-existence of Internet Services and halaal manner-of-existence of Digital
Ecosystems. As such we provide our definitions for use of the labels Libre-Halaal for
Software, Internet Services and Digital Ecosystems in [<a href="#PLPC-120041"></a>].</p><p>The Free Software<a id="hevea_default58"></a> and Open Source movements and their combination the Free and open-source
software (F/OSS, FOSS) or free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS) have been attempting to
address this labeling challenge. Because their philosophical and moral analysis is
shallow, all of their labels are problematic in a number of respects.</p><p>The FLOSS movement lacks deep recognition of IPR regime being just Western and does not
call for full abolishment of the IPR regime. 
The FLOSS movement lacks deep recognition of the place of
software as a special form of digital polyexistential. 
The FLOSS movement lacks deep
recognition of importance of morality and role of software engineering profession in
formulation of definitions and labels.</p><p>But since we have the “Libre” label in common, we use the “Libre-Halaal” label when
operating in Western authority. Where our rejection of the copyright regime is through
FLOSS copyleft licensing. And where we wish to express common cause with our FLOSS brothers and
sisters.</p>

Our profession, the Software Engineering profession, is hindered by the Western so-called
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime. As engineers instead of being able to freely
collaborate, we are enticed to compete. Instead of collectively inventing and innovating
towards the good of society, the Western IPR model pushes us to individually reinvent.</p><p>Software and Internet Services have become an integral and critical component of societal
functioning, and the consequences for humanity are enormous. Of fundamental importance in
this regard is what we will call the <em>manner of existence</em> of software.</p><p>We present the Halaal <em>manner of existence</em> of software and Internet services in:

. 
The Western IPR regime adversely impacts our ability to produce Libre-Halaal software and Internet services.</p><p>It is for this reason that we are writing this paper. While polyexistentials are far
broader than software, we emphasis software in this presentation for two reasons. First,
we are software engineers. Second, the collaborative and cumulative and usage orientation
of software (as a polyexistential) permits us to demonstrate the natural power of
polyexistentials in contrast to Western so-called Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
regime. This of course is demonstrated in success of the Libre-Halaal GNU/Linux in contrast to
the proprietary MS Windows.</p>

right and wrong can be reached based on logic, they are absolute.
Such rights and wrongs are not a matter of
opinion, personal, societal or global beliefs.</p><p>It is not unusual for global beliefs to be wrong and counter to basic
logic. By “global beliefs” or “societal beliefs” we mean spheres
of consensus that are global or societal in scope. People are often
born into such wrong global/societal beliefs and ordinary people are
often unable to follow correct basic logic when they have been
brainwashed from birth.</p><p>In due course some unrecognized societal mistakes can be recognized and understood. When

Faith-based reasoning led the Inquisition to hold fast to a
complex and convoluted Ptolemaic model of the universe rather

</li></ul><p>By “global fundamental mistakes” we mean the types of mistakes that put all of
us in danger.
Some global mistakes can, in due course, put humanity in danger.
The Western Intellectual Property Rights Regime is one such example.</p><p>Some global mistakes are not very harmful – they result in
sub-optimum societal/global human environments. “Ill Conception of The Metric System”
and “Backwards-ness Of Internet Domain Notation” are some such examples.</p><p>Contemporary global mistakes often result in entrenched vested interests. Such deep
economic interests often prevent people’s willingness to hear and follow basic logic.</p><p>In all cases, it is good to follow basic logic and understand these

 <sup><a id="text6" href="#note6">1</a></sup></p><p>History of copyright law is generally very Western.</p><p>Copyright came about with the invention of the printing press and
with wider literacy. As a legal concept, its origins in Britain
were from a reaction to printers’ monopolies at the beginning of
the 18th century. The English Parliament was concerned about the
unregulated copying of books and passed the Licensing of the
Press Act 1662, which established a register of licensed books
and required a copy to be deposited with the Stationers’ Company,
essentially continuing the licensing of material that had long
been in effect.</p><p>The Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution (1787) authorized copyright legislation.</p><p>The 1886 Berne Convention first established recognition of
copyrights among sovereign nations, rather than merely
bilaterally. Under the Berne Convention, copyrights for creative
works do not have to be asserted or declared, as they are
automatically in force at creation: an author need not "register"
or "apply for" a copyright in countries adhering to the Berne
Convention. As soon as a work is "fixed", that is, written or
recorded on some physical medium, its author is automatically
entitled to all copyrights in the work, and to any derivative
works unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them, or
until the copyright expires. The Berne Convention also resulted
in foreign authors being treated equivalently to domestic
authors, in any country signed onto the Convention. The UK signed
the Berne Convention in 1887 but did not implement large parts of
it until 100 years later with the passage of the Copyright,
Designs and Patents Act of 1988. Specially, for educational and
scientific research purposes, the Berne Convention provides the
developing countries issue compulsory licenses for the
translation or reproduction of copyrighted works within the
limits prescribed by the Convention. This was a special provision
that had been added at the time of 1971 revision of the
Convention, because of the strong demands of the developing
countries. The United States did not sign the Berne Convention
until 1989.</p><p>Iran<a id="hevea_default60"></a> is a non-signatory to WTO (Western Trade Organization) copyright laws.</p>

sec:AboutPatentLaw —,
we provide an overview of the patent system.</p><p>History of patent law is generally very Western.</p><p>Patents were systematically granted in Venice as of 1450, where
they issued a decree by which new and inventive devices had to be
communicated to the Republic in order to obtain legal protection
against potential infringers. The period of protection was 10
years. As
Venetians emigrated, they sought similar patent protection in
their new homes. This led to the diffusion of patent systems to
other countries.</p><p>By the 16th century, the English Crown
would habitually abuse the granting of letters patent for
monopolies. After public outcry, King James I of England (VI
of Scotland) was forced to revoke all existing monopolies and
declare that they were only to be used for “projects of new
invention”. This was incorporated into the Statute of Monopolies
(1624) in which Parliament restricted the Crown’s power
explicitly so that the King could only issue letters patent to
the inventors or introducers of original inventions for a fixed
number of years. The Statute became the foundation for later
developments in patent law in England and elsewhere. James
Puckle’s 1718 early autocannon was one of the first inventions
required to provide a specification for a patent.</p><p>Important developments in patent law emerged during the 18th
century through a slow process of judicial interpretation of the
law. During the reign of Queen Anne, patent applications were
required to supply a complete specification of the principles of
operation of the invention for public access. Legal battles
around the 1796 patent taken out by James Watt for his steam
engine, established the principles that patents could be issued
for improvements of an already existing machine and that ideas or
principles without specific practical application could also
legally be patented. Influenced by the philosophy of John
Locke, the granting of patents began to be viewed as a form of
intellectual property right, rather than simply the obtaining of
economic privilege.</p><p>The English legal system became the foundation for patent law in
countries with a common law heritage, including the United
States, New Zealand and Australia. In the Thirteen Colonies,
inventors could obtain patents through petition to a given
colony’s legislature. In 1641, Samuel Winslow was granted the
first patent in North America by the Massachusetts General Court
for a new process for making salt.</p><p>The modern French patent system was created during the Revolution
in 1791. Patents were granted without examination since
inventor’s right was considered as a natural one.</p><p>The first Patent Act of the U.S. Congress was passed on April 10,
1790, titled "An Act to promote the progress of useful Arts".
The first patent was granted on July 31, 1790,</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec101" History Of Intellectual Property-->
<h3 id="sec101" class="subsection">6.2.4  History Of Intellectual Property</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The term Intellectual Property is an after thought. The history
of trademark, copyright and patent were well established before 
the very first introduction of the term “Intellectual Property”.</p><p>The first known use of the term intellectual property dates to
1769, when a piece published in the Monthly Review used the
phrase. The first clear example of modern usage goes back as
early as 1808, when it was used as a heading title in a
collection of essays.</p><p>The German equivalent was used with the founding of the North
German Confederation whose constitution granted legislative power
over the protection of intellectual property (Schutz des
geistigen Eigentums) to the confederation. When the
administrative secretariats established by the Paris Convention
(1883) and the Berne Convention (1886) merged in 1893, they
located in Berne, and also adopted the term intellectual property
in their new combined title, the United International Bureaux for
the Protection of Intellectual Property.</p><p>The organization subsequently relocated to Geneva in 1960, and
was succeeded in 1967 with the establishment of the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) by treaty as an agency
of the United Nations. According to Lemley, it was only at this
point that the term really began to be used in the United States
(which had not been a party to the Berne Convention), and it
did not enter popular usage there until passage of the Bayh-Dole

<h2 id="sec102" class="section">6.3  Multi-Disciplinary Discrediting Of The Western So-Called IPR Regime</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Westerners adopted the IPR regime without much understanding and logic. </p><p>To take away those most basic natural human rights of “Applying Knowledge” and
“Copying” demands solid logic and proof on the side of those who want to take away these
rights. Those who believe in the Western IPR regime need to convince those who reject it.
Not the other way around.</p><p>In the last 200 years, a colossal mistake has been made by Westerners. Ownership and
capitalism were extended into the realm of polyexistentials, creating Intellectual
Property Rights.</p><p>Many generations have been born into this mistake and now the mistake has become default
truth for many Westerners.</p><p>So, to deal with Western IPR in the West we need more than logic. Below, we address some
of the entrenched fallacies associated with the Western IPR regime.</p><p>To those that are not born into the IPR mistake or who can 
think for themselves,
the simple logic of “Nature Of Polyexistentials” that we presented above would be more
than sufficient. The conclusion is obvious and simple: The Western IPR Regime should be
abolished.</p><p>But, it is naive to imagine that sound logic and correct philosophy can be the basis for
abolishment of the Western IPR Regime.</p><p>This is because of a number of a reasons, including: 
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Intellectual Property Rights regime is now an integral part of Western cultures. Even
after it becomes obvious that the Western intellectual property rights regime is
corrupt, economic interests will keep it in place. In many ways this parallels the
history of Slavery in America.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Western societies are primarily economically driven. Correct philosophy, harmony
with nature, logic, and Halaal and Haraam; generally (if not always) remain fringe
concepts for Westerners.
</li><li class="li-itemize">The Proprietary model is fully entrenched. And the course for using the proprietary
model for internal and external exploitation is already fully charted.
</li></ul><p>As with any other social structure with the benefactors being in
power, and the victims seeing the structure as normal, it is very
difficult to change the status quo. Those promoting the Intellectual
Property Rights Regime have a vested interest in maintaining the
system and will do so at all cost. Abolishment of the Western IPR Regime must
begin with bringing a level of understanding of the exploitation and
conflict with nature of the IPR to those being disadvantaged by the
system.</p><p>Calling for abolishment of the Western IPR regime is reasonable. But in practical terms
we should recognize that it won’t be abolished. So, in parallel for that call we should
work on cures to this Western disease.</p><p>Our exposition in this part is polemic. This is not a debate. Nature is against
the Western IPR regime and we are on the side of nature.</p>

<a id="chap:OwnershipMistakes:WesternSlaveryAndTheWesternIPRRegime"></a>

</p><p>Horrible things happen when a society gets its ownership rules wrong.</p><p>For the Anglo-American culture, a recent acknowledged ownership
mistake is slavery of Africans in America.</p><p>The Anglo-American culture is in the midst of making another ownership
mistake: That of the ownership of polyexistentials. This time things
are more subtle and more difficult to understand, as the victims and
oppressors are less obvious.</p><p>The Western so-called Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime
(Western copyright and patent law) is a sin of our time, the same way that
Western slavery was a sin of the West’s previous generations.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec104" Parallels Between Western Slavery And The Western IPR Regime-->
<h2 id="sec104" class="section">7.1  Parallels Between Western Slavery And The Western IPR Regime</h2><!--SEC END --><p>The parallel that we draw here is in the context of distorted or
proper “ownership rules” — not cruelty or kindness.
When we use the words “Slave” and “Slavery”, we are purely
focused on the property and ownership aspect of a human by 
another human.</p><p>American/Western slavery of Africans is rooted in the American belief
of white superiority and black inferiority. Based on that belief
Americans/Westerners could then regard blacks
as subhuman and therefore “ownable”.
And, the revered United States Constitutional Convention could
at most get to The Three-Fifths Compromise.
Atrocities and involuntary servitude are then derivatives of ownership.
It is the notion of ownership laws that should be the focus.</p><p>In the case of slavery of Africans in America, the primary common
thought is the cruelty exercised by White Americans/Europeans against
Black Africans. That cruelty and racism was cemented through the
distortion of Laws of Ownership. Thus, even though in the case of
slavery, cruelty and racism are commonly viewed as dominant; it is
really the distortion of Laws of Ownership which should be viewed as
the causal mistake. In the context of parallels between western
slavery and the western IPR regime, our focus is distortion of
ownership rules first and the cruelty that it cultivates second. In
the case of the Western IPR regime, the cruelty is not as immediately
visible. Yet it is very real as well. In fact, we will argue that the
harm of the Western IPR regime will be far greater than that of
slavery — as the victims are more numerous and that recognition of
the cruelty is latent.</p><p>To understand our point, in the context of slavery of Africans in
America; the reader should view distortion of ownership rules primary
and cruelty and racism as secondary. Needless to say exploitation of
some by some-others, in the form of economic justifications (that
are full of externalities), is what drives that distortion of ownership
rules which then results in enduring cruelty and injustice.</p><p>In this section we focus on some parallels between Western
slavery And Western intellectual property rights regime.</p><p>We draw these parallels to show that the harm and dangers of Western
IPR ownership mistake surpass the previous Western ownership mistake
(Western Slavery).</p><p>Slavery had been practiced all over the world for thousands of years,
but never before had so many people from one continent been
transported to another against their will. American’s formality and
form of ownership was unique. The current size and make up of American
prisons are also very unique and exceptional. When we speak of
“Western Slavery”, it is this particular form of ownership and
slavery that we are pointing to.</p><p>It is not savagery and lack of humanity of American society that is
the point we wish to make in this section. We provide these example
to draw attention to long term ramifications of Western ownership
mistakes in general and the current Western IPR regime mistake in
particular. American Slavery<a id="hevea_default61"></a> is the previous now well understood 
Western ownership mistake.</p><p>Below we go through various aspects of these colossal Western mistakes
that have obvious parallels and similarities.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec105" Things That Should Not Be Owned-->
<h2 id="sec105" class="section">7.2  Things That Should Not Be Owned</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Both Western Slavery and Western IPR regime are about owning what
should not be owned.</p><p>This obvious simple concept is not one that you arrive to through
business and economics. It is based on basic philosophy, logic, ethics
and respect for nature.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec106" Ownership Of Human Beings-->
<h3 id="sec106" class="subsection">7.2.1  Ownership Of Human Beings</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Western Slavery was about very formal ownership of human beings. 
Despite full formality, Western Slavery was
without regard for ramifications of interbreeding with what you
own. And the question of ownership of your own child.</p><p>Today, a First Lady of America,
Michelle Obama<a id="hevea_default62"></a>, has no comment about her own genealogy. At the age of
six, Melvinia<a id="hevea_default63"></a>, who was Michelle Obama’s great-great-great grandmother,
was passed on as <span style="font-weight:bold">property</span> (valued at $475 
) to Paterson’s daughter and son-in-law —
Christianne and Henry Shields — after his death in 1852. Some years
later, when she was still a teenager, she gave birth to a boy, Dolphus
T Shields. Dolphus was recorded in the census as “mulatto” - denoting
one white and one black parent. The identity of the father is not
known, though the fact that his surname was Shields suggests he may
have been a member of the family that <span style="font-weight:bold">owned</span> Melvinia<a id="hevea_default64"></a>.</p><p>In the 19th century, in America, human beings were formally owned.
Interbreeding with one’s property was common place and the master’s
own child became property again. On this scale and in this form, all
of this is exceptionally American.</p><p>So, now in the 21st century, for the very first time we have the
descendants of a salve as America’s First Lady. The ancestors of
the President himself, Barack Obama<a id="hevea_default65"></a>, do not
seem to have been slaves. Americans have not yet chosen a
descendant of their slaves as President.</p><p>Note here that the modern term “African-American” is quite
confusing. Both Michelle Obama<a id="hevea_default66"></a> and Barack Obama<a id="hevea_default67"></a> are called
African-Americans. Barack Obama<a id="hevea_default68"></a> is a descendant of Africans who chose
to become American. Just like the Irish-Americans (say John
F. Kennedy). Michelle Obama<a id="hevea_default69"></a> is a descendant of African
slaves. Michelle Obama and her ancestors did not have much of a choice
for becoming American.</p>

<h2 id="sec108" class="section">7.3  Short Term Economic Benefits</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Both Western slavery and Western IPR regime have managed to produce
benefits to a select few. Consider the following as anecdotes:</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec109" Slaves And The Cotton Economy-->
<h3 id="sec109" class="subsection">7.3.1  Slaves And The Cotton Economy</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The rise of “King Cotton” as the defining feature of southern life
revitalized slavery. The promise of cotton profits encouraged a
spectacular rise in the direct importation of African slaves in
the late 18th century and early 19th century.
250,000 new slaves arrived in the United States from 1787 to
1808, a number equal to the entire slave importation of the colonial
period. </p><p>Cotton also contributed to the national economy. The crop comprised
more than half the total value of domestic exports in the period
1815-1860, and in 1860, earnings from cotton paid for 60 percent of
all imports. Cotton also built up domestic capital, attracted foreign
investment, and contributed to the industrial growth. In
the early 1800s, northeastern merchants began channeling commercial
profits into industrial production of cloth (using cotton).</p><p>So, much American prosperity was built on the back of African slaves. In
that economic process, Americans destroyed an entire continent and an
entire people (cultures, languages, customs, etc.).</p><p>Economics is inherently full of externalities.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec110" Viagra Patents and Pfizer-->
<h3 id="sec110" class="subsection">7.3.2  Viagra Patents and Pfizer</h3><!--SEC END --><p>In the American economic model, the single most revealing measure of
an innovation’s economic value is the market’s response to it. On this
measure, Viagra offers a striking example: Sales of the drug grew very
rapidly after launch, and those of its competitors fell dramatically.</p><p>All of Viagra profits are anchored in a set of patents.</p><p>The target for Viagra is the 50 year old man who is having
trouble and is very willing to pay for his trouble.</p><p>So, we can see how the Western patent system, has focused innovation
and creativity amongst drug makers to exactly where the money is. </p><p>But what about the real patient, the sick, who has to pay for the
artificial scarcity that the patent system creates?</p><p>Economics is inherently full of externalities.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec111" Long Term Economic Costs-->
<h2 id="sec111" class="section">7.4  Long Term Economic Costs</h2><!--SEC END --><p>With economics you usually have to worry about two things. First is
externality and second is short term benefits vs long term costs.</p><p>These economic considerations apply to both Western Slavery and
Western IPR regime.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec112" Descendant Of Slaves and the Make Up Of The US Prison System-->
<h3 id="sec112" class="subsection">7.4.1  Descendant Of Slaves and the Make Up Of The US Prison System</h3><!--SEC END --><p>American slavery ended with American civil war. Long term costs
of American slavery of course continued and continues.</p><p>Today descendants of Africans made slaves, <sup><a id="text7" href="#note7">1</a></sup>, who Anglo-American culture now labels the
African-American men, are close to 14% of the population of men
in the U.S.</p><p>Today, male descendants of Africans made slaves, represent close
to 40% of America’s prison population. Separate from cruelty,
taking care of that large poulation is costly.</p><p>With respect to female descendants of Africans made slaves,
consider this <sup><a id="text8" href="#note8">2</a></sup>: Black moms across the
US are three and a half times more likely to die in childbirth
than white Americans. There is a cost associated with the
knowledge of that cruelty. Aside from the harm, the fact that
Blck Lives Matter, has now become a catchphrase. Anglo-American
culture has to live with that shame forever.</p><p>All of this is uniquely and exceptionally American.</p><p>So, to the old masters, the descendants of Africans made slaves have
now become less economically attractive.</p><p>And yet, the topic of reparations has not even been materially
been put on the table.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec113" Never Ending Patent Wars and Aggregate Costs Of Artificial Scarcity-->
<h3 id="sec113" class="subsection">7.4.2  Never Ending Patent Wars and Aggregate Costs Of Artificial Scarcity</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Many have come to conclude that patents are stifling innovation.</p><p>“patent assertion entities,” better known as patent trolls, whose
business model consists of holding many low-quality patents and suing
infringers, real or otherwise. The trolls threatened to sue more than
100,000 companies in 2012. Some seem like
little more than extortion rackets. They prey on smaller businesses by
claiming, for example, that a jewelry boutique is violating a patent
every time it scans a document. One study concludes that defendants
paid $29 billion in 2011 to trolls, four times what they paid in 2005.</p><p>Patents have now become a lawyers’ game. A zero sum game that
produces nothing. But the cost of just running the game is of
course significant. And that is eventually passed to the consumer.</p>

Much of President Obama’s net worth is through his copyrighted books.
Even, Bush Junior, recognized how he can cash his shares through the

<!--TOC section id="sec117" America’s Founding Fathers and the US Constitution-->
<h2 id="sec117" class="section">7.6  America’s Founding Fathers and the US Constitution</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Many Americans take the US constitution very seriously and regard 
“America’s Founding Fathers” as reverend.</p><p>The US Constitution has been exceptionally wrong both with respect to
Slavery and IPR.</p><p>These catastrophic mistakes of the US Constitution are fundamentally
rooted in the economic nature of this document. Above all, US
Constitution is a business plan – by the business-man for the
business-man. “Freedom” is included in that business plan as a
business ingredient. Individual Freedom in due course will be extended
to include Corporate Freedom. Freedom of the weak is viewed as a source
of income.</p><p>The American two layers model of law and economics is very simple.
And in that simple two layered model, one important purpose of law is
to accommodate economics. People are viewed as economic creatures. And
society is the collection of economic creatures and their economic dynamics. A
very simple and effective business plan.</p><p>Human beings born into this colossal American business plan — The US
Constitution —, in no time become economic creatures. They become
Americanized.</p><p>To pay lip service to any remaining human needs of economic creatures,
individualistic freedom becomes the main pillar of American morality.
Conveniently, the US Constitution and the American economic model
celebrates individual freedoms. Based on those individualistic
freedoms, the sophisticated American corporation is then well
positioned to manipulate the naive American individual — that simple
economic creature. With that form of American morality in place, the
American corporation then demands those individualistic freedoms for
itself. The American model then amounts to a complete collection of
economic creatures (people and corporations alike). Should such a
collection be called a society? What is American society?</p><p>Humans are to be first right and wrong (halaal and haraam) oriented and 
only after that, they should be economically oriented.
Right and wrong are often orthogonal to economics and profit, as
externality is an inherent characteristic of economics.</p><p>The notion of focusing on right and wrong instead of economics is
generally foreign to Americans.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec118" Slavery And The US Constitution-->
<h3 id="sec118" class="subsection">7.6.1  Slavery And The US Constitution</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Slavery is seen in the US Constitution in a few key places. </p><p>The first is in the Enumeration Clause, where representatives are
apportioned. Each state is given a number of representatives based on
its population - in that population, slaves, called "other persons,"
are counted as three-fifths of a whole person. This compromise was
hard-fought, with Northerners wishing that slaves, legally property,
be uncounted, much as mules and horses are uncounted. Southerners,
however, well aware of the high proportion of slaves to the total
population in their states, wanted them counted as whole persons
despite their legal status. The three-fifths number was a ratio used
by the Congress in contemporary legislation and was agreed upon with
little debate.</p><p>In Article 1, Section 9, Congress is limited, expressly, from
prohibiting the "Importation" of slaves, before 1808. The slave trade
was a bone of contention for many, with some who supported slavery
abhorring the slave trade. The 1808 date, a compromise of 20 years,
allowed the slave trade to continue, but placed a date-certain on its
survival. </p><p>The Fugitive Slave Clause
is the last mention. In it, a problem that slave states had with
extradition of escaped slaves was resolved. The laws of one state, the
clause says, cannot excuse a person from "Service or Labour" in
another state. The clause expressly requires that the state in which
an escapee is found deliver the slave to the state he escaped from "on
Claim of the Party."</p><p>So, here we have America’s founding fathers, speaking of how all men
are created equal during the day and then banging their slaves at
night. And who knows who is to own the results of all that banging –
their own children. </p><p>So, now early in the 21st century, some African American are seeking
to prove a genetic link to James Madison<a id="hevea_default70"></a>.</p><p>This of course provides a window for understanding the character of
America’s founding fathers — and by extension a window to the
character of American society.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec119" Copyright And Patents In The US Constitution-->
<h3 id="sec119" class="subsection">7.6.2  Copyright And Patents In The US Constitution</h3><!--SEC END --><p>US Constitution Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, reads:</p><blockquote class="quote"><p>The Congress shall have power ...</p><p>To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for
limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their
respective writings and discoveries;
</p></blockquote><p>The heart of the mistake of the authors of the US Constitution is that
writings and discoveries of authors and inventors are
polyexistentials.</p><p>Restricting polyexistential by grants of exclusive right in
fact hinders progress of science and useful arts. </p><p>In other words, lack of understanding of America’s founding fathers as
to how science and useful arts progress has now become a disease –even more
grave than slavery – that the American society has to live with.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec120" Role And Place Of Religions-->

<!--TOC subsection id="sec121" Slavery In Christianity Vs. Slavery In Islam-->
<h3 id="sec121" class="subsection">7.7.1  Slavery In Christianity Vs. Slavery In Islam</h3><!--SEC END --><p>To recognize the part played by the Christian churches in the slave
trade one may consider the following anecdotes. Many priests
themselves carried on slave-trading, especially in Angola, and many
others owned slaves in the Americas. The only reason the Catholic
church give for its action was that it was trying to save African
souls by baptizing the slaves. The Protestants were worse, for they
did not even make it clear that they accepted that the Africans had a
soul. Instead, they supported the view that the African slave was a
piece of property like a furniture or a domestic animal. There is no
part of the history of Christian church which was more disgraceful
than its support of the Atlantic slave-trade.</p><p>When ships loaded with human cargo sailed from Christian countries to
Western hemisphere, Christian priests used to bless the ship in the
name of Almighty and admonish the slaves to be obedient. It never
entered into their minds to admonish the masters to be kind to the
slaves.</p><p>Islam’s historical record with respect to slavery is much cleaner than
Christianity’s record. </p><p>Malcolm X said that Islam was the "true religion of black mankind" and
that Christianity was "the white man’s religion" that had been imposed
upon African Americans by their slave-masters.</p><p>In a Christian country, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., chose to become 
Muhammad Ali<a id="hevea_default71"></a>.</p><p>Islam’s approach to the question of slavery was more philosophical,
ethical and societal. And less economic.
All Quranic rules on slaves are emancipatory in that they improve
the rights of slaves compared to what was already practiced in
the 7th century. Many Muslims have interpreted Quran as
gradually phasing out slavery.</p><p>One key rule in Isalm played an important role in gradually
phasing out slavery. A female slave who gives birth to her
owner’s child becomes an “umm walad” (’mother of a child’) and
becomes automatically free upon the death of her owner. The child
would be automatically free and equal to the owner’s other
children.</p><p>Contrast this Moslem rule against the American/Christian one-drop
rule of even early 20th century which asserts that any person
with even one ancestor of black ancestry (“one drop” of “black
blood”) is considered black (Negro or colored in historical
terms).</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec122" IPR In Christianity Vs. IPR In Islam-->
<h3 id="sec122" class="subsection">7.7.2  IPR In Christianity Vs. IPR In Islam</h3><!--SEC END --><p>For the most part Christianity has been silent on the question of IPR.</p><p>Islam on the other hand, and Shiite tradition in particular, has been quite
explicit in rejecting the Western IPR regime.</p><p>Imam Khomeini’s Fatwa in particular is succinct in declaring the
fundamental invalidity of Western Copyright and Patent law.</p><p>For a description of the basis for rejection of the Intellectual
Property Rights regime by Iranian ethicists, see <em>Iran’s Theological
Research on Intellectual Property Rights</em> [<a href="#Repub-120028"></a>].</p><p>The Christian clergy needs to wake up. Similar to slavery, the
Western Intellectual Property Rights is a critical ownership topic
that needs to be directly addressed by the Church based on morality
and theology — not economics.</p>

<!--TOC subsection id="sec124" Employees Of Shipping Lines and King Leopold-->
<h3 id="sec124" class="subsection">7.8.1  Employees Of Shipping Lines and King Leopold</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Adam Hochschild the author of
“King Leopold’s Ghost, A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in
Colonial Africa”[<a href="#NOTYET"></a>]. He chooses to start the story with
Edmund Dene Morel.</p><p>It is Morel and his profession that we want to underscore in this
story. Morel’s profession positioned him such that he could see
slavery in Congo as it was happening. He then exposed what he
understood to the rest.</p><p>Hochschild is an excellent writer. Here is how he describes it in
the very beginning pages of this long book.</p><blockquote class="quote"><p>THE BEGINNINGS of this story lie far back in time, and its
reverberations still sound today. But for me a central incandescent
moment, one that illuminates long decades before and after, is a
young man’s flash of moral recognition.</p><p>The year is 1897 or 1898. Try to imagine him, briskly stepping
off a cross-Channel steamer, a forceful, burly man, in his mid-
twenties, with a handlebar mustache. He is confident and well
spoken, but his British speech is without the polish of Eton or
Oxford. He is well dressed, but the clothes are not from Bond
Street. With an ailing mother and a wife and growing family to
support, he is not the sort of person likely to get caught up in an
idealistic cause. His ideas are thoroughly conventional. He looks—
and is—every inch the sober, respectable businessman.</p><p>Edmund Dene Morel is a trusted employee of a Liverpool
shipping line. A subsidiary of the company has the monopoly on all
transport of cargo to and from the Congo Free State, as it is then
called, the huge territory in central Africa that is the world’s only
colony claimed by one man. That man is King Leopold II of
Belgium, a ruler much admired throughout Europe as a
“philanthropic” monarch. He has welcomed Christian missionaries to
his new colony; his troops, it is said, have fought and defeated local
slave-traders who preyed on the population; and for more than a
decade European newspapers have praised him for investing his
personal fortune in public works to benefit the Africans.
Because Morel speaks fluent French, his company sends him to
Belgium every few weeks to supervise the loading and unloading of
ships on the Congo run. Although the officials he works with have
been handling this shipping traffic for years without a second
thought, Morel begins to notice things that unsettle him. At the
docks of the big port of Antwerp he sees his company’s ships
arriving filled to the hatch covers with valuable cargoes of rubber
and ivory. But when they cast off their hawsers to steam back to the
Congo, while military bands play on the pier and eager young men
in uniform line the ships’ rails, what they carry is mostly army
officers, firearms, and ammunition. There is no trade going on here.
Little or nothing is being exchanged for the rubber and ivory. As
Morel watches these riches streaming to Europe with almost no
goods being sent to Africa to pay for them, he realizes that there
can be only one explanation for their source: slave labor.</p><p>Brought face to face with evil, Morel does not turn away.
Instead, what he sees determines the course of his life and the
course of an extraordinary movement, the first great international
human rights movement of the twentieth century. Seldom has one
human being—impassioned, eloquent, blessed with brilliant
organizing skills and nearly superhuman energy—managed almost
single-handedly to put one subject on the world’s front pages for
more than a decade. Only a few years after standing on the docks
of Antwerp, Edmund Morel would be at the White House, insisting
to President Theodore Roosevelt that the United States had a
special responsibility to do something about the Congo. He would
organize delegations to the British Foreign Office. He would
mobilize everyone from Booker T. Washington to Anatole France
to the Archbishop of Canterbury to join his cause. More than two
hundred mass meetings to protest slave labor in the Congo would
be held across the United States. A larger number of gatherings in
England—nearly three hundred a year at the crusade’s peak —
would draw as many as five thousand people at a time. In London,
one letter of protest to the Times on the Congo would be signed by
eleven peers, nineteen bishops, seventy-six members of Parliament,
the presidents of seven Chambers of Commerce, thirteen editors of
major newspapers, and every lord mayor in the country. Speeches
about the horrors of King Leopold’s Congo would be given as far
away as Australia. In Italy, two men would fight a duel over the
issue. British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, a man not given

least thirty years has moved the country so strongly and so

its target, of the long period of exploration and conquest that
preceded it, and of the way the world has forgotten one of the great
mass killings of recent history.</p></blockquote><p>Through his profession, Morel understood what is going on. He
recognized that he has to act on this understanding.
Communication of the understanding of the harm to the rest of the

years ago, when I noticed a footnote in a book I happened to be
reading. Often, when you come across something particularly
striking, you remember just where you were when you read it. On
this occasion I was sitting, stiff and tired, late at night, in one of the
far rear seats of an airliner crossing the United States from east to
west.</p><p>The footnote was to a quotation by Mark Twain, written, the
note said, when he was part of the worldwide movement against
slave labor in the Congo, a practice that had taken eight to ten
million lives. Worldwide movement? Eight to ten million lives? I was
startled.</p><p>Statistics about mass murder are often hard to prove. But if this
number turned out to be even half as high, I thought, the Congo
would have been one of the major killing grounds of modern times.
Why were these deaths not mentioned in the standard litany of our
century’s horrors? And why had I never before heard of them? I
had been writing about human rights for years, and once, in the
course of half a dozen trips to Africa, I had been to the Congo.</p><p>That visit was in 1961. In a Leopoldville apartment, I heard a
CIA man, who had had too much to drink, describe with
satisfaction exactly how and where the newly independent country’s
first prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, had been killed a few months
earlier. He assumed that any American, even a visiting student like
me, would share his relief at the assassination of a man the United
States government considered a dangerous leftist troublemaker. In
the early morning a day or two later I left the country by ferry
across the Congo River, the conversation still ringing in my head as
the sun rose over the waves and the dark, smooth water slapped
against the boat’s hull.</p><p>It was several decades later that I encountered that footnote,
and with it my own ignorance of the Congo’s early history. Then it
occurred to me that, like millions of other people, I had read
something about that time and place after all: Joseph Conrad’s
Heart of Darkness. However, with my college lecture notes on the
novel filled with scribbles about Freudian overtones, mythic echoes,
and inward vision, I had mentally filed away the book under fiction,
not fact.</p><p>I began to read more. The further I explored, the more it was
clear that the Congo of a century ago had indeed seen a death toll
of Holocaust dimensions.</p><p>At the same time, I unexpectedly found
myself absorbed by the extraordinary characters who had peopled
this patch of history. Although it was Edmund Dene Morel who had
ignited a movement, he was not the first outsider to see King
Leopold’s Congo for what it was and to try hard to draw the
world’s attention to it. ...</p></blockquote><p>It is one thing to understand what is going on. It is another
thing to deeply undertand the scope, extent, scale and importance
of what is going on. Let’s focus on one of Hochschild’s
observations. He writes: “The further I explored, the more it
was clear that the Congo of a century ago had indeed seen a death
toll of Holocaust dimensions.” Notice two things in his
observation. One is use of upper case “H” in Holocaust, the
second is limitation of comparison to Congo.
</p><p>While it is the responsibility of professions to blow the whistle
early on. It is a collective responsibility to deeply undertand
the scope, extent, scale and importance over time and in due

<h3 id="sec125" class="subsection">7.8.2  Software Engineering Profession And Copyright</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Based on the particular aspect of our professions’ relationship
to patents and copyright, many of us are “Intellectual Workers”.</p><p>Our professions — be it: software, engineering, teaching,
research, arts, journalism, medicine, pharmacy, plant biology,
etc. — all involve production or propagation of Intellectual
Property. As a medical doctor, when you prescribe patented
medications, you are propagating patents. As a software engineer
working for the likes of Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc
when you write code, you are producing copyrighted opaque,
restricted and proprietary software and internet services.</p><p>Hence, the way that the patent and copyright systems operate
impact our professions. The impact of Intellectual Property on
our professions is always negative. IPR impedes our ability to
share and to collaborate. Each of our profession’s responsibility
towards health of the society and the responsibilities of each of
us towards our profession demands that we reject the Western IPR
regime.</p><p>This responsibilities oriented model is distinct and different
from the generally economic American model. If you do not believe
in the notion of the responsibilities that we mentioned, then you
are likely part of the problem.</p><p>With respect to IPR, among all professions of Intellectual
Workers, Software Engineers hold a special place. Software is
inherently collaborative and cummulative. We are software
engineers. The negative impacts of the Western IPR regime on our
profession has been significant. And we have been well positioned
to understand the harm.</p><p>Over the past 40 years or so, we have done various things to
address these harms. Inside of the Western IPR regime, some of us
have produced public software licenses that revert us back to the
natural collaborative environment which the traditional Western
copyright regime replaces. In Chapter <a href="#NOTYET%2CDigital%0ANon-Proprietary%20Movements">??</a> we describe these strategies in some
detail.</p><p>Then, based on the public software licenses, over the past 40
years, collaboratively we built a whole lot of non-propietary
(Libre-Halaal) software. Today, the overwhelming majority of
internet infrastructure runs on non-proprietary software. In the
realm of internet software, there is no debate. The Libre-Halaal
model is superior to the Western IPR based Proprietary-Haraam
model. We have demonstrated that for software development, the
natural collaborative environment is supperior to the artificial
competetive environment that Western IPR regime wants to create.</p><p>The notion of superiority of the natural collaborative
environment over the artificial competetive environment that
Western IPR regime attempts to create is in no way limited to
just software. It applies to all polyexistentals. It should then
be clear that the entirety of the Western IPR regime is a failed
experiment.</p><p>Yet, hardly any of these understandings are widespread in
mainstream belief systems. So, books like this need to be
written. It is towards fulfillment of our responsibilities to our
profession and our profession’s responsibility to society and
humanity that we are writing this book.</p>

Reference Model” that we developed in Chapter
<a href="#chap%3ANatureOfPolyexistentials">3</a> –

all amount to symptoms analysis and do not go to the root of the
problem. They do not explicitly and strongly call for the
abolition of IPR. They also do not move towards the right
solutions – Halaalness of manner-of-existence of
polyexistentials. And in the current Western environment where
very powerful entities are in control of economy, legislation and
Western society, such opposition amounts to academic naggings.
In this document, we want to do more than that.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is clear that even in the West there is a large size awareness of the
notion that the IPR regime is a grave mistake.
Many Westerners have reached the correct conclusion that: there
is no such thing as a right to own intangible ideas and, therefore,
the whole regime of grants of monopoly is an unjust and outdated
political construct that should be tossed aside. </p><p>Yet these Western awarenesses are not profound.
As Demings puts it: 
</p><blockquote class="quote">
“A system cannot understand itself. The transformation requires a view from outside.”
</blockquote><p>The profound understanding of the fraudulence of the Western IPR
regime needed to come from Easterners. The Polyexistentials
Reference Model represents the Eastern perspctive of focusing on the
society (through the possessed) and not the indiviual (through the

Copyright law in the United States is founded on the Constitutional goal of “promoting
the Progress of Science and useful Arts” by providing exclusive rights to

distribute them to the public. In doing so, the law strikes a number of important
balances in delineating what can be protected and what cannot, determining what uses are
permitted without a license, and establishing appropriate enforcement mechanisms to
combat piracy, so that all stakeholders benefit from the protection afforded by
copyright.

ownership to useful polyexistentials, you can create a competitive environment which is superior
(in economic and societal terms) to the natural collaborative environment of
multi-possessablity of polyexistentials.</p><p>This of course is pure theory. There was no proof of this theory when
the US Constitution was written. So, at best IPR in the US
Constitution was an experiment. It is a failed experiment in that

<h2 id="sec141" class="section">8.5  Falacy: Copyright Law Restricts Plagiarism</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Martin, in [<a href="#IPR-BrianMartin"></a>], puts it this way:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Many intellectual workers fear being plagiarised and many of
them think that intellectual property provides protection against
this. After all, without copyright, why couldn’t someone put their
name on your essay and publish it? Actually, copyright provides
very little protection against plagiarism. So-called “moral
rights” of authors to be credited are backed by law in many
countries but are an extremely cumbersome way of dealing with
plagiarism.
Plagiarism means using the ideas of others without adequate
acknowledgment. There are several types of plagiarism. One is
plagiarism of ideas: someone takes your original idea and, using
different expression, presents it as their own. Copyright provides
no protection at all against this form of plagiarism. Another type
of plagiarism is word-for-word plagiarism, where someone takes
the words you’ve written—a book, an essay, a few paragraphs or
even just a sentence—and, with or without minor modifications,
presents them as their own. This sort of plagiarism is covered by
copyright—assuming that you hold the copyright. In many
cases, copyright is held by the publisher, not the author.<p>In practice, plagiarism goes on all the time, in various ways
and degrees, and copyright law is hardly ever used against it.
The most effective challenge to plagiarism is not legal action but
publicity. At least among authors, plagiarism is widely condemned. 
For this reason, and because they seek to give credit
where it’s due, most writers do take care to avoid plagiarising.
There is an even more fundamental reason why copyright
provides no protection against plagiarism: the most common sort
of plagiarism is built into social hierarchies. Government and
corporate reports are released under the names of top bureaucrats 
who did not write them; politicians and corporate executives give
speeches written by underlings. These are examples of
a pervasive misrepresentation of authorship in which powerful
figures gain credit for the work of subordinates. Copyright, if
it has any effect at all, reinforces rather than challenges this sort
of institutionalised plagiarism.
</p></blockquote><p>To frame this in concrete terms, consider the following real case:</p><blockquote class="quote">
WASHINGTON, Sept. 17, 1987 — Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.,
fighting to salvage his Presidential campaign, today acknowledged
”a mistake” in his youth, when he plagiarized a law review
article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school.
Mr. Biden insisted, however, that he had done nothing
”malevolent,” that he had simply misunderstood the need to cite
sources carefully. And he asserted that another controversy,
concerning recent reports of his using material from others’
speeches without attribution, was ”much ado about nothing.”
</blockquote><p>Note that there is no mention of copyright anywhere in Biden’s
case. What Biden had done never caused any harm or challenge
to anyone’s copyright monopoly.</p>

<!--TOC section id="sec145" On IP Placibos And Self-Fulﬁlling Prophecies-->
<h2 id="sec145" class="section">8.9  On IP Placibos And Self-Fulﬁlling Prophecies</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Gold et al. in [<a href="#IPR-GoldMorin"></a>] note:</p><blockquote class="quote">
The underlying intuition of a placebo, or self-fulﬁlling prophecy,
is well described by Merton as follows: “A false deﬁnition of the
situation evoking behavior which makes the originally false
conception come true”. The danger with these
situations is that they lead to strong claims that are false. As
Merton explains, “the prophet will cite the actual course of events
as proof that he was right from the beginning”. In
other words, the deﬁning characteristic of a placebo is that it is
the very consequences of the belief that make reality conform to the
initial belief and that believers “fail to understand how their own
belief has helped to construct that reality”.
The economics literature has its own treatment of placebos and
self-fulﬁlling prophecies. These arise in economies presenting
multiple potential equilibria in which untested expectations
non-trivially determine the equilibrium into which they eventually
fall. These expectations “are
unrelated to the preferences, endowments or production set of any
individual, and yet come to inﬂuence the forecast and actions of
economic decision-makers” . We
can regard economic outcomes as the sum of two distinct effects: (i)
direct (structural) effects and (ii) indirect (behavioral) effects.
A growth model with strong indirect
effects would exhibit placebo characteristics. Where different
groups of individuals hold beliefs based on distinct yet false
conceptions – such as one group believing in the effect of sunspots
and another in those of “moonspots” – each will ﬁnd “factual”
support for their beliefs, leading to increased faith (and, hence,
stability) in the false belief. <p>A policymaker who knows that economic growth is 
driven by indirect, rather than direct, effects of IP has greater
room to increase growth by exerting inﬂuence on individuals’ beliefs
and behavior rather than through increasing levels of IP
protection. For example, she could focus on changing beliefs –
through education – or on inducing the same behavior through other
means at a lower cost. Yu suggests that a
self-fulﬁlling prophecy lay in China’s decision to embrace higher
levels of IP protection (facially, at least) in the late 1970s after
it opened its markets to foreign trade. He argues that while this
increased protection had no direct effect on growth, inevitably some
sectors and regions would see economic growth after (but not
causally related to) the change. Observers then wrongly attributed
this growth to the direct effect of IP and called for even greater
levels of IP protection. “And,” Yu notes, “the cycle would repeat
itself”. Our theory generalizes and adds precision
to Yu’s suggestion. It holds that IP as written in formal laws –
rather than how these laws operate in practice – has less of a
direct role in inﬂuencing growth than thought. Instead, a group of
foreign investors, believing (even if falsely) that IP always drives
growth, invest in countries that adopt these laws without
necessarily engaging the IP system itself (e.g. by actually
obtaining, defending, and licensing IP rights). There are various
reasons why such actors may hold these beliefs even in the absence
of direct economic effects, ranging from the symbolic – higher
levels of IP protection signal a pro-investor policy environment –
to the mystical – that IP will inevitably lead the country to higher
rates of growth. In the end, the result is the same: actors’ faith
in the growth effects of increased IP protection drives investment
and thus leads to growth despite the absence of direct causality.
</p></blockquote><p>Gold et al. in [<a href="#IPR-GoldMorin"></a>] conclude that:</p><blockquote class="quote">
[The presented results] are consistent with the
placebo theory that states that a belief in the positive effects of
increases in levels of IP protection on growth drive both formal IP
and investments made in an economy.
</blockquote><p>What Gold et al. fail to recognize is that their analogy between IP and placebo
is off in one very important respect.
With respect to the placebo effect, they make it clear that IP is
unnecessary – and they are correct in that regard. However, the
placebo is designed to be harmless, but IP is harmful and evil.</p><p>Economists should note that economic analysis is always full of
externalities. And this economic placebo causes a great deal of societal harm.</p>

... reveals one remarkable characteristic in the evolution of
continental legal doctrine: its rather "spontaneous" and
international character. By spontaneous I mean that the evolution
toward a relative consensus about the property concept was not
organized from a single center. It was neither the product of a
brilliant Lycurgean legislator or the outcome of the action of an
organized social group. The growing consensus about the property
concept evolved from a dialogue among learned jurists from different
parts of the European continent. This dialogue was an ongoing
intellectual process lasting several centuries. The jurists of
France, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, and Italy consulted foreign
texts, commented on them, and gradually refined their theoretical
approach. Although this spontaneous origin of the property concept
does not provide a conclusive argument for its rightness, it reveals
at least its intersubjective and intertemporal character. The least
we can say is that the property theory of the continental legal
tradition passed through a test of a multitude of critical insights
of learned and experienced legal scholars. For this reason, it is
legitimate to assign to such a gradually evolved theory a
presumption of rightness and to charge its opponents with the burden
of proof about the contrary.
</blockquote><p>From the perspective of religions as well, there is universal concensus on
ownership of monoexistentials and what theft is and what theft is not.
All Ibrahimic<a id="hevea_default87"></a> religions (and other major religions) include “Thou shalt not steal”.
Additionaly, Eastern perspective in ownership of monoexistentials is same as the
Western perspective. </p><p>Therefore with regard to the existing laws of ownership of

assign the burden of proof about the contrary to the opponents.</p><p>Bouckaert, in [<a href="#IPR-Bouckaert"></a>], further elaborates:</p><blockquote class="quote">
With regard to the debate on intellectual property, the question
arises whether this presumption of rightness by tradition can be
extended to this kind of property. Is it possible to allot
intellectual property the same traditional weight as corporeal
property goods? The history of the origin of the several kinds of
intellectual property on the continent suggests a negative answer to
this question. The origin of intellectual property rights has its
historical roots in deliberate interventions by political
authorities rather than in the spontaneously evolved continental
legal tradition.
</blockquote><p>There is nothing approaching the notion of IP in any of the
Ibrahimic<a id="hevea_default88"></a> religions (or any other major religion). Additionaly, Eastern
perspective in ownership of polyexistentials differs greatly from the
Western IP perspective.</p><p>Therefore with regard to the existing Western IP laws we should start

The burden of proof should be on those who wish to take away such
basic natural rights.</p><p>Additionally, sharing polyexistentials still allows the original possessor to
use them. Therefore, the burden of proof should lie on those
who argue for intellectual property.</p><p>In the following sections, after debunking arguments in favor of IP,

One problem with the [labor-based or] creation-based approach is
that it almost invariably protects only certain types of creations—
unless, that is, every single useful idea one comes up with is
subject to ownership (more on this below). But the distinction
between the protectable and the unprotectable is necessarily
arbitrary. For example, philosophical or mathematical or scientific
truths cannot be protected under current law on the grounds that
commerce and social intercourse would grind to a halt were every new
phrase, philosophical truth, and the like considered the exclusive
property of its creator. For this reason, patents can be obtained
only for so-called “practical applications” of ideas, but not for
more abstract or theoretical ideas. Rand agrees with this disparate
treatment, in attempting to distinguish between an unpatentable
discovery and a patentable invention. She argues that a “scientific
or philosophical discovery, which identifies a law of nature, a
principle or a fact of reality not previously known” is not created
by the discoverer. But the distinction between creation and
discovery is not clearcut or rigorous. Nor is it clear why such a
distinction, even if clear, is ethically relevant in defining
property rights. No one creates matter; they just manipulate and
grapple with it according to physical laws. In this sense, no one
really creates anything. They merely rearrange matter into new
arrangements and patterns. An engineer who invents a new mousetrap
has rearranged existing parts to provide a function not previously
performed. Others who learn of this new arrangement can now also
make an improved mousetrap. Yet the mousetrap merely follows laws of
nature. The inventor did not invent the matter out of which the
mousetrap is made, nor the facts and laws exploited to make it work.<p>...</p><p>Both the inventor and the theoretical scientist engage in creative
mental effort to produce useful, new ideas. Yet one is rewarded, and
the other is not. In one recent case, the inventor of a new way to
calculate a number representing the shortest path between two
points – an extremely useful technique – was not given patent protection
because this was “merely” a mathematical algorithm. But it is
arbitrary and unfair to reward more practical inventors and
entertainment providers, such as the engineer and songwriter, and to
leave more theoretical science and math researchers and philosophers
unrewarded. The distinction is inherently vague, arbitrary, and
unjust.</p></blockquote>

necessarily involves arbitrary distinctions with respect to what

by widening the scope of IP, and by lengthening its

threat to tangible-property rights, and would threaten to

individuals to use their physical property as they see fit.</p><p>This would be based on the assumption that wealth or utility could be
maximized by adopting certain legal rules. Unless this assumption is

believe that this assumption is false.</p><p>But for now, let us suppose that it is correct.</p><p>Kinsella, in [<a href="#IPR-StephanKinsell"></a>] addresses this:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Even then, this does not show that these rules
are justified. For example, one could argue that net utility
is enhanced by redistributing half of the wealth of society’s
richest one percent to its poorest ten percent. But even if
stealing some of A’s property and giving it to B increases
B’s welfare “more” than it diminishes A’s (if such a comparison could, somehow, be made), this does not establish
that the theft of A’s property is justified. Wealth maximization is not the goal of law; rather, the goal is justice—giving
each man his due. Even if overall wealth is increased due
to IP laws, it does not follow that this allegedly desirable
result justifies the unethical violation of some individuals’
rights to use their own property as they see fit.<p>...</p><p>It is debatable whether copyrights and patents really are necessary to
encourage the production of creative works and inventions, or that the
incremental gains in innovation outweigh the immense costs of an IP
system.</p><p>Econometric studies do not conclusively show net gains in
wealth. Perhaps there would even be more innovation if
there were no patent laws; maybe more money for research
and development (R&amp;D) would be available if it were not
being spent on patents and lawsuits. It is possible that companies would have an even greater incentive to innovate if
they could not rely on a near twenty-year monopoly.</p><p>...</p><p>It is not clear that society is better off with relatively more
practical invention and relatively less theoretical research
and development. </p><p>...</p><p>We must remember that when we advocate certain
rights and laws, and inquire into their legitimacy, we are
inquiring into the legitimacy and ethics of the use of force.
To ask whether a law should be enacted or exist is to ask:
is it proper to use force against certain people in certain
circumstances? It is no wonder that this question is not
really addressed by analysis of wealth maximization. </p><p>Utilitarian analysis is thoroughly confused and bankrupt: talk
about increasing the size of the pie is methodologically
flawed; there is no clear evidence that the pie increases with
IP rights. Further, pie growth does not justify the use of
force against the otherwise legitimate property of others.
For these reasons, utilitarian IP defenses are unpersuasive.

we outlined in Section 
<a href="#sec%3ALimitationsOfContractLawOnPolyexistentials">3.9.8</a>
and recognizing that restricting the
polyexistential component of mixed-existential imposes on its
monoexistential component, some 
IP advocates shift from a purely
contractual approach to a “reservation of rights” approach
in which property rights in monoexistentials tangible resources are seen as a
divisible bundle of rights.</p><p>Kinsela in [<a href="#IPR-StephanKinsell"></a>] describes this in some detail:</p><blockquote class="quote">
For example, under the standard bundle-of-rights view, a landowner
can sell the mineral estate to an oil company while retaining all
rights to the surface, except for an easement (servitude) granting
passage to a neighbor and a life estate (usufruct) granting use of
the surface estate to his mother. Drawing on the bundle-of-rights
notion, the “reservation of rights” approach holds that a type of
“private” IP can be privately generated by creatively “reserving
rights” to reproduce tangible items sold to purchasers. Rothbard,
for example, argues that one can grant conditional “ownership” (of
“knowledge”) to another, while “retaining the ownership power to
disseminate the knowledge of the invention.” Or, Brown, the inventor
of an improved mousetrap, can stamp it “copyright” and thereby sell
the right to each mousetrap except for the right to reproduce
it. Like the real rights accompanying statutory IP, such
“reservations” allegedly bind everyone, not just those who have
contracted with the original seller. Thus, third parties who become
aware of, purchase, or otherwise come into possession of the
restricted item also cannot reproduce it—not because they have
entered into a contract with Brown, but because “no one can acquire
a greater property title in something than has already been given
away or sold.” In other words, the third party acquires a tangible
thing—a book or a mousetrap, say—but it is somehow “missing” the
“right-to-copy” part of the bundle of rights that “normally”
constitutes all rights to the thing. Or, the third party acquires
“ownership” of information, from a person who did not own the
information and, thus, was not entitled to transmit it to others.
</blockquote><p>The implications of such a view are troubling. Palmer in [<a href="#IPR-Palmer"></a>]
writes:</p><blockquote class="quote">
The separation and retention of the right to copy from the bundle of
rights that we call property is problematic. Could one reserve the
right, for example, to remember something? Suppose that I wrote a
book and offered it to you to read, but I had retained one right:
the right to remember it. Would I be justified in taking you to
court if I could prove that you had remembered the name of the lead
character in the book?

mistake, things are even more complicated.
Ramifications of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) ownership mistake
are very grave. They put humanity in danger.</p><p>In an abstract sense, the victim is the polyexistential which is being
restricted. More tangibly, it is the people who suffer from the artificial
scarcity of the polyexistential.</p><p>This artificial scarcity takes the form of the ill person whose life depends
on the medication whose patent holder makes it unaffordable; of Indian
farmers to whom access to their most versatile resource, the neem
tree, is being restricted by chemical companies’ patents; and of all
the people who want to share digital literature or music or art or software
who are unable to because of restrictive laws surrounding ownership of
polyexistentials.</p><p>Thus, all of humanity is victimized and oppressed by the scarcity created by patent and
copyright holders.</p><p>It is in humanity’s interest to abolish the Western IPR regime.</p><p>Widespread adoption of IPR in America and in the West has created
certain environments and certain trends which have already destroyed
many human institutions in Western societies.</p><p>Such destructions are often not pure ramifications of 
the IPR regime. The IPR regime is being used by Corporations 
to destroy individuals and professions.</p><p>In this model, IPR has become a vehicle for concentration of wealth and

<!--TOC section id="sec160" The Paralyzing Effects Of Western IPR On Health Of Professions-->
<h2 id="sec160" class="section">9.2  The Paralyzing Effects Of Western IPR On Health Of Professions</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Each profession has a responsibility to society towards protecting a certain aspect of
life.</p><p>Here we are using the term “profession” in the way it is understood in the East.</p><p>The notion of a “profession” in the West consists of training and the acquisition of
specialized skills, to perform specialized work, to create monetary income. The
responsibility of a profession towards society at large does not factor significantly in
this. Western society is mostly, if not totally, economically driven. The Western model of
economically driven individuals existing within an industrial context considers only money
and self-interest. Such broader concepts as society, profession, responsibility and
respect are very weak in the Western model.</p><p>In the East the word “profession” carries a greater meaning. It
includes the Western meaning of a specialized skill set to perform
work of value to others. But it also includes an agenda of trust and
responsibility. The professional person is entrusted by society to
maintain guardianship over an important aspect of life. Based on
proper execution of this responsibility, the profession is respected.</p><p>The primary author of this document, attests that:
for him as an engineer it is only in Iran that he is called “Mr. Engineer Banan <a id="hevea_default89"></a>.” That has
never happened to him in America, Canada, England, France, or anywhere else in his travels
throughout the Western world.</p><p>So it is in this Eastern sense that we are here speaking of “professional
responsibility.”</p><p>An indirect consequence of the Western IPR regime is empowerment of financiers,
corporations and corpocracy<a id="hevea_default90"></a>.</p><p>An indirect consequence of the Western IPR regime is to the detriment of professions, society and
individual.</p><p>A particularly powerful tool of business to dominate and crush
professions is the so called Intellectual Property regime. The
recognition that by rejecting Patents, Copyrights and the norms of
trade secrecy many professions can protect themselves against business
dominance is badly absent in most professions.</p><p>Journalism can be more productive and resistant to business corruption
by rejecting copyright and adopting copyleft. Pharmaceutical,
Bio-Medicine and Medicine can be more productive and resistant to
business corruption by rejecting patents and adopting the patent-free
model.</p><p>The software engineering profession has already demonstrated how by
adopting the copyleft and patent-free models it can resist dominance
by business. GNU/Linux has stood up against the Microsoft monopoly.</p><p>The principles of the software engineering profession’s collaborative
model can be reapplied to many other professions.</p><p>In essence the solution is in properly defining polyexistential
capitalism.</p><p>Consider the Software Engineering profession, which is hindered by the Western so-called
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime. As engineers instead of being able to freely
collaborate, we are enticed to compete. Instead of collectively inventing and innovating
towards the good of society, the Western IPR model pushes us to individually reinvent.</p><p>Software and Internet Services have become an integral and critical component of societal
functioning, and the consequences for humanity are enormous. Of fundamental importance in
this regard is what we will call the <em>manner of existence</em> of software.</p><p>We present the Halaal <em>manner of existence</em> of software and Internet services in:

. 
The Western IPR regime adversely impacts our ability to produce Libre-Halaal software and Internet services.</p><p>It is for this reason that we are writing this paper. While polyexistentials are far
broader than software, we emphasis software in this presentation for two reasons. First,
we are software engineers. Second, the collaborative and cumulative and usage orientation
of software (as a polyexistential) permits us to demonstrate the natural power of
polyexistentials in contrast to Western so-called Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
regime. This of course is demonstrated in success of the Libre-Halaal GNU/Linux in contrast to
the proprietary MS Windows.</p>

</p><p>Based on philosophy, nature and logic we have made a case that
makes it clear that Western IPR regime is in conflict with
nature. The logic that demonstrates polyexistentials are
unownable is sufficient to pursuade anyone who thinks with his
brain and whose interests do not conflict with the natural
conclusions of our discourse.</p><p>But human rationality is a myth. Both individually and in groups
people don’t think with their brain. People think with their
character. Dominant aspects of their character that impact their
thinking are self-interest and their value system.</p><p>So, to understand the root causes of the Western IPR mistake we
should ask who are the people who have come up with these
unnatural ownership rules that are designed to create artificial
scarcities? And what is the character of the people who have come
up with IPR and who are protecting IPR.</p><p>Unlike existence and possession that are aspects of nature, ownership is a man made construct.
Ownership rules can therefore directly be associated with the people who made them.
As a set of ownership rules, IPR regime is a Western and American construct.</p><p>To better understand the Western IPR regime we may profit from better
understanding the culture of those who created and who are
promoting IPR. We label the ideology of those who created and are
promoting IPR, “Americanism”. Our use of Americanism is not as a 
nationality label, it is a character type and belief system label.</p><p>By Americanism, we are referring to a particular established model of
economic creatures existing in an exploitative industrial context.
We will refer to the American spheres of consensus that we describe in this section
which has shaped the core of American character as "The Proprietary American
Regime" – and sometimes just "The American Regime" or
“Americanism”. 
We refer to
the model as Americanism and we call those who believe in and exercise
this model “Americanists”. 
We draw a clear distinction between being
an American National and being Americanist.
It is the belief system and not Americans as
individuals that we are referring to – while recognizing that
the core of character of most American individuals shapes the
American Regime and is shaped by it. 
Furthermore, the belief
system that we call Americanism physically and geographically
spans far further than the United States of America. Many
through out the world have been inflicted by this disease and have become
“Americanized”.</p>

<h2 id="sec164" class="section">10.1  Americanism And The Economics Of IPR</h2><!--SEC END --><p>
<a id="sec:AmericanismAndTheEconomicsOfIPR"></a>
</p><p>Western IPR assumes that human beings are essentially economic
creatures and that if they are not economically rewarded they will not
engage as much in activities that progress science and useful arts.
Western IPR regime assumes that human beings are competition oriented and
collaborative values are inferior to competition for advancement of 
science and useful arts.</p><p>Economics is the study of what people do when nothing more
important than money is at stake. Even though twenty first
century planet earth is too primitive to be generally governed by
anything but economics, there are variations for the place of
economics in societies. Western IPR is fully rooted in economics. The
Western IPR regime was created and is being promoted in this
American context. </p><p>To the extent that it can be considered a culture, the American
culture understands this – and is proud of it. In the movie “Killing
Them Softly”, the actor Brad Pitt, in a key scene, puts it like this:</p><blockquote class="quote"><p>“This guy [Obama] wants to tell me we are living in a comunity.
Don’t make me laugh. I’m living in America and in America you are on
your own.</p><p>America is not a country. America is just a business.</p><p>Now, just [.......] pay me.
</p></blockquote><p>It is in this pure business sense that Wester Intellectual Property
exists.</p><p>Right and wrong are often orthogonal to economics and profit, as
externality is an inherent characteristic of economics.
In the
spirit of combating west-toxication «غرب زدگی», [<a href="#Repub-120024"></a>], Imam Khomeini, captured
this difference in a short crisp sentence: “basis of everything for the donkey too is its economics” – «الاغ هم زیربنای همه چیزش اقتصادش
است». <sup><a id="text9" href="#note9">1</a></sup>
Our model for humanity is inherently complex and intertwines:
religion, morality, ethics, economics, business, law, language, culture, society
and nature. Western IPR regime is not rooted in harmony with nature,
morality or ethics.</p><p>To pay lip service to any remaining human needs of economic creatures, individualism and
individualistic freedom becomes the main pillar of Western morality. Conveniently, the
Western economics model celebrates individual freedoms. Based on those individualistic
freedoms, the sophisticated Western corporation is then well positioned to manipulate the
naive Western individual. With that form of Western morality in place, the Western
corporation then demands those individualistic freedoms for itself. The American/Western
legal system then kicks in and formalizes the Western legal notions of “corporate
personhood”. The Western model then amounts to a complete collection of economic
creatures (people and corporations alike). 
Should such a collection be called a society?
What is Western society?
It is inside of this model that the Western IPR regime has thrived.</p>

<a id="sec:ProprietaryAmericanistValues"></a>
</p><p>The concepts and laws of IPR has been shaped by proprietary American values.
And this is the root cause of the problem.
In particular, the proprietary American model is based on:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Supremacy<a id="hevea_default93"></a> of business and economics – Leaving no room for societal, social,
philosophical or moral considerations in the base fabric of society.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Unbounded Corporations. The Corporation, an entity whose sole purpose is to generate
profit is permitted to do all that it pleases and in many respects is considered
equivalent with human individuals. This model reduces humans to the level of Corporations –
greed driven psychopaths.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Elimination or marginalization of role of professions (Internet Engineering) in society.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Corpocracy<a id="hevea_default94"></a> – Where collaboration of Corporation and Government results in
manipulation and control of the People.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Extreme Individualism<a id="hevea_default95"></a> – Rampant Self-Toxication At Epidemic Levels. 
Stressing personal freedoms, out of balance against 
significance of health of society and humanity,
play well into manipulation of individuals by corporations.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Uses of IPR as an instrument to exploit other societies and cultures. Based on
American Exceptionalism.
</li></ul><p>These dynamics are such that proprietary American model puts not just America, but the 
entirety of human civilization in danger.</p><p>The American model is being portrayed to the world as universal.
It is not. There is more to the world than the American regime. 
The American regime has produced well understood results for other crucial
aspects of life that the civilized world has fully rejected.
Much of the world wishes to be separate from the American regime.</p><p>Americanism is inherently exploitative. It often results into
short term prosperity for its practitioners at a cost to
others. Sometimes the practitioners don’t recognize that they are
also the others.</p><p>Consider how Americans eat. The American “Food Inc<a id="hevea_default96"></a>.” model has turned the American
farmer into instruments of agro-business machinery of patented economic
processes. Partaking food by humans has been turned into manipulation of the economic
creatures by the business. Human beings have been turned into economic creatures existing
in an exploitative industrial context for the purpose of the business of consuming food. Obesity is
prevalent amongst the poor in America.</p><p>Consider how Americans take care of their sick. Health and medicine has been fully
subjected to capitalism. Everyone for himself. The doctor-patient relationship has become
a fully economic transaction. Insurance business has been placed on the top and the
patient at the very bottom while the American doctor has become nothing more than a tool
of business. 
The rich think that this works very well for them. In the aggregate, it is a miserable
failure. For example, Cuba with a fraction of resources produces infant mortality rate
results that compare very well against the American Regime’s. 
The obvious human model of universal health
care which is practiced through out the civilized world is considered nasty socialism in
America.</p><p>Consider how Americans view prescription medications. The Anglo-American culture permits
advertising of prescription drugs on Television. Nowhere else in the world is this
permitted. The exclusive producer of the patented medication is permitted to dangle the
cure in front of the sick in public – and hardly any American recognizes 
this as a clear sign for the road to end of civilization and humanity.
The profession of medicine is by-passed by the
business where the sick is encouraged to tell the doctor what to do.</p><p>Consider how Americans consider university education. The average American graduate comes
out $35K in debt. 
The American higher education system is for the rich and the
indebted. 
The purpose of education has become preparation for economic
activity.
American academia has been fully corporatized. 
In the American model, learning too has become a purely economic activity.</p><p>Consider how Americans view their guns. When extreme individualism is at the center,
ridiculous arguments for ridiculous freedoms become the norm. The distance from there, to
“going postal”, “Columbine”, “Sandy Hook”, etc. is very little. American savagery
is truly exceptional!</p><p>Consider how Americans view relations with other
societies. America’s short history points to exploitation,
colonialism, dominance and imperialism as clear trends. The
natives are now concentrated in reservations. The African
continent has been destroyed and the African languages and
cultures were bulldozed into oblivion. Descendants of those
African slaves are now a majority in American prisons. The use
of the atomic bomb, the ultimate weapon of mass destruction, was
initiated by Americans. The CIA’s clandestine coups to manipulate
and exploit Iranians, Arabs, South-Americans, etc. are celebrated
and glamorized through the 
American
Hollywood. The patterns of Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and
Syria point to the inability of Americans to listen, understand
and learn.</p><p>Much of the civilized world has looked at these American models and has fully rejected them.</p><p>When Americans try to impose their models for monoexistentials on
others, rejections of these American models by the rest of the world,
often takes the form of: “Yankee Go Home”, “Go To Hell Yankee” and
“Death To America” chants followed by physical rejection and
separation. And that has kind of worked for some – e.g., the 1979
Iranian Revolution.</p><p>But rejection of Americanist models for polyexistentials is more
complicated.</p>

of reviewing their actions and feeling contrition or regret for past
wrongs is not part of Americanism.</p><p>If it was to be left to the Americanists, there is every reason to
expect that the above mentioned self-toxications, bullying,
destruction and uncivilized patterns of exploitation will be repeated.</p><p>Given these trends, should the world accept the American regime’s
model of IPR for polyexistence and polyexistentials which
Americanists propagate in the form of so-called Intellectual Property
as tools for continued exploitations?</p><!--TOC section id="sec167" Exclusion Of Americanism From Polyexistentials Governance-->

</p><p>The Japanese/Brazilian/Iranian/Chinese/French/Cuban/Indian/Russian/etc models for food,
medicine, university education and guns are distinctly different from the American
model. Much of the civilized world looks at the American model and sees a purely
economically oriented savage model. This of course is very different from what Americans
see when they look in the mirror. This degree of self-absorption and these extremes of
American monocultures of the mind are genuinely exceptional.</p><p>Unlike, food, guns and medicine (monoexistentials) which are inherently local, the
inherent polyexistential nature of IPR restriction is global.
Adoption of the purely proprietary American model of IPR
puts civilization and humanity in danger.</p><p>Rejection of the American proprietary model of the Internet is far more complicated than
rejecting the local American models of food, medicine, guns, etc. Slogans and chants are
ineffective and complete physical separation is impractical. 
A large segment of the planet has already come to recognize that the 
greatest threat to humanity is Americanism. It is wholly wrong to allow the 
Proprietary American IPR to become a propagation vehicle for Americanism.
It should not be permitted.</p><p>The Americanist’s Intelectual Property Rights model of governance of
polyexistentials is rooted in extreme individualism
and self-toxication.
Instead we want to adopt a human oriented model for governance of polyexistentials.</p><p>Saadi,  «سعدی» , has well expressed this
distinction between self-toxicated economic creatures and
humans:</p><p><br>
<br>
</p><p>2
Human beings are members of a whole<br>
In creation of one essence and soul<br>
If one member is afflicted with pain<br>
Other members uneasy will remain<br>
If you have no sympathy for human pain<br>
The name of human you cannot retain<br>

IPR problem.
Proposing and analyzing solutions are an equally important aspect of this document.</p><p>What can be done? By Whom? How? </p><p>For any of the proposed solutions to be significant, solutions need to
be at societal level and exposition of concepts in this document are
geared towards establishing societal relationships.</p><p>We view the Western so-called IPR Regime as a disease. It is a sick
way of thinking and a sick way of behaving that becomes an inherent
condition. It is abnormal in that it is against nature of
polyexistentials. This disease can spread from one society to the
next. It is like alcoholism, it brings short term pleasure but long
term despair. Not just for the alcoholic but for all concerned.</p><p>We therefore label our effort to restore societal behavior to its normal condition
(Libre-Halaal Polyexistentials) not a solution to a problem but a cure for the disease.</p><p>In context of cures, there are 3 dimensions of scope that need to be recognized:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
What types of polyexistentials (corresponding/mapping to professions) should be
initial primary focuses? By types of polyexistentials we are referring to digitals,
software, internet services, knowledge in general, knowledge of medications, etc.</li><li class="li-enumerate">Which societies should we focus on? Eastern cures are
inherently different from what may be applicable to the West.
Furthermore, in the IPR context economic interests of East and West
are different. It is possible for the Libre-Halaal model to do an
economic number on the Western IPR based Proprietary model.</li><li class="li-enumerate">What general type of activities do we focus on?
By type of activities we are referring to informative, 
academic, promulgative, tangible, or theoretical.</li></ol><p>Prior to selecting our focal points, we need to analyze the battle ground.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec170" Dynamics of the Proprietary-Haraam vs. Libre-Halaal Battle-->
<h2 id="sec170" class="section">11.1  Dynamics of the Proprietary-Haraam vs. Libre-Halaal Battle</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Endorsement of the Western IPR model leads to the Proprietary-Haraam
manner-of-existence of polyexistentials which then usually leads to
the competition oriented internally opaque digital entities.</p><p>Rejection of the Western IPR model can lead to the Libre-Halaal
manner-of-existence of polyexistentials which then leads to
the collaborative oriented internally transparent digital entities.</p><p>In software’s context, though this is not part of popular
cultural awareness, there is currently a titanic battle taking
place between two competing ideologies: the Proprietary-Haraam
model (exemplified by Windows), and the
Libre-Halaal<a id="hevea_default97"></a> model (exemplified by
GNU/Linux). This is a to-the-death battle, from which there can
eventually emerge only a single winner.</p><p>Of course, this battle is part of a broader ideological contest,
about ownership models for polyexistentials in general
(software, but also including ideas, knowledge, literature,
music, images, movies, etc.) in the digital era. Current
ownership models are rooted in the historical conventions and
institutions of material products and materially-based
services. In the case of abstract constructs such as software,
these conventions appear in the form of the existing Intellectual
Property (IP) regime, where proprietary ownership is asserted by
means of patents and copyright.</p><p>But the inherent nature of software, Internet services and other polyexistentials is
fundamentally at odds with these historical conventions of physical property
(monoexistentials) ownership. Such constructs have the inherent potential for unlimited
replicability and dissemination, and in the age of the Internet this potential is now
fully realized.</p><p>As a result the existing western Intellectual Property conventions are coming under
increasing stress, as the internal forces of replicability clash with the externally
constraining Intellectual Property framework. The Intellectual Property regime is also
coming under formal intellectual attack, as the dysfunctionality and true costs of this
regime become increasingly apparent.</p>

work against Proprietary-Haraam model and those
which are in harmony with the Libre-Halaal model –
and have identified a number of “tear points”. Our execution is
focused on these tear points.</p><p>Some of these tear points are more applicable to Eastern societies and some are more
applicable to Western societies.</p><p>We present and analyze these tear points with the goal of providing a cure
in the context of formulation of national
policies for Eastern societies and ad-hoc adoption amongst Westerners.</p>

The digital domain in particular is an area where
we can explicitly focus on. In other words the initial scope of the cure is 
that of a “Digital Ecosystem”.</p><p>The Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem can not be fixed. Its dynamics are taking it to
a particular eventuality – destruction of civilization and humanity.</p><p>Instead we need to erect an alternative digital ecosystem to stand against it.</p><p>Software is a unique form of polyexistentials.
Software has the best chance of illustrating and correcting the Western IPR mistake
because it has the following attributes:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Software is practical and useful. It plays a pervasive role in our daily lives.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Software controls other digital entities and therefore it impacts internet services
and content.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Software development is highly collaborative in nature.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Software is inherently cumulative in nature.
</li></ul><p>For these reasons we believe that the software battle is the best
initial front against the proponents of the Western IP regime. Other
fields and professions –
pharmacists, physicians,
plant biologists, farmers, academics/students, and others –
can build on our efforts and mimic our approach.</p><p>In the realm of software and internet, we offer creation of the Libre-Halaal ByStar
digital ecosystem as a moral alternative to the Proprietary-Haraam American digital
ecosystem.</p><!--TOC subsection id="sec173" Inherently Collaborative vs Inhernetly Competitive-->

Libre-Halaal software and Libre-Halaal Internet Services are genuine public resources, not owned by
anyone, freely available for reuse by anyone. They are created by society, for
society.</p><p>This general proven collaborative model permits for collective efforts for replacing
American Proprietary Software which from the perspective of an Eastern society is far more
cost effective than the proprietary competitive model.</p>

<h2 id="sec177" class="section">12.1  Overview</h2><!--SEC END --><p>In this essay we introduce the terms “halaal” «حلال» and
“haraam” «حرام» into Globish. 
Halaal and haraam are facilities
that assist with expression of moral sensibilities. 
It is a good thing for people to be
better equipped to express their moral sensibilities. It is a good thing for different
societies to move towards consensus on moral topics through dialogue. The inclusion of halaal
and haraam in Globish assists with that. </p>
<!--TOC section id="sec178" Shortcomings of English in the Domain of Morality-->
<h2 id="sec178" class="section">12.2  Shortcomings of English in the Domain of Morality</h2><!--SEC END --><p>English is strong in some domains and weak in others.</p><p>The strength and weakness of English in various domains is of course directly related to
the culture and value system of the native speakers of this language, most notably the
Americans and the British.
Culture and language are intertwined. Syntax and semantics are adjunct.</p><p>In the domain of business, economics and finance (that is to say, money) English is very
strong. In the domain of money English is rich with terms such as: MBS (Mortgage-Backed
Securities), shorting, margin, hedge fund, haircut, reverse mortgage, EPS, P/E, dead cat
bounce, double down, bubble, pyramid scheme, day trading, pump-and-dump, spin-and-flip,
and many others. In Anglo-American English, the term for the world’s largest casino is
“the stock market.” Equivalents for most of these terms do not exist in most other
languages, because these concepts do not exist in other cultures. Values, thinking and
behavior influence language; and conversely, language influences values, thinking and
behavior.</p><p>Economics is the study of what people do when nothing more important than money is at
stake. Even though twenty first century planet earth is too primitive to be governed by
anything but economics, there are variations for the place of economics in societies. With
its purest form, Americans have ended up with a collection of economic creatures existing
in an industrial complex, which they call American society. And in that context, English,
the language of Americans and the British, has ended up being very economically
oriented. It is towards evolution beyond economic creatures that we want to
introduce halaal into Globish.</p><p>In the domain of morality, ethics and philosophy, English is extremely weak. Fundamental
human concepts from other cultures such as Halaal and Haraam, Mottainai (もったいない),
Esraaf «اصراف» or Ghanawt «قناعت» are entirely absent
from English. And previous attempts to translate these terms into English have been
miserable failures. This is because these are complex concepts that do not exist within
the value system of the Americans and British.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec179" Current Orientalist Appropriation Of Halaal In English-->
<h2 id="sec179" class="section">12.3  Current Orientalist Appropriation Of Halaal In English</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Looking up the words “halaal” and “haraam” in Wikipedia, or in Encyclopedia Britannica
or Webster’s dictionary, provides at best an over-simplification, or at worst complete
garbage. Viewing haraam as meaning just “prohibited” and viewing halaal as meaning just
“permissible” is shallow and simplistic. Limiting the scope of applicability of halaal
and haraam to Islamic dietary laws and then trying to simplify halaal based on parallels
between halaal meat and kosher meat are sophomoric at best. The concepts of halaal and
haraam are far more complex than that.</p><p>Not only is Anglo-American English weak in regard to expression of morality, but the
culturally egocentric Americans (and Westerners generally) are allergic
to the expression of morality by others. In Anglo-American English, the
word halaal is loaded with connotation. More than anything else, it evokes immediate
feelings of Islamophobia.</p><p>Westerners tend to define East and eastern terms and concepts in their own context and for
their own benefit. And not just that, Western definition of eastern terms and concepts are
often intended to degrade eastern and Moslem concepts in the spirit of establishing Western superiority
and towards Western exploitation of the East and Moslems.
Edward Said has labeled this
Western model of looking at the East and Moslems as: “Orientalism”, [<a href="#Orientalism"></a>]. 
In English, halaal and
haraam have been subjected to Orientalism. The scope of applicability of halaal for the
most part has been reduced and the concept has been overly over simplified.</p><p>Our definition of halaal rejects the current Orientalist appropriation in English
and focuses on introducing the real concept of halaal in Globish.
The Western and the West-toxicated readers should in particular recognize the 
distinction that we are drawing between English and Globish and the distinction 
that we are drawing between the
Orientalist appropriation of halaal in English and the real meaning of halaal 
that we are introducing into Globish.</p><p>Halaal is a fundamental, deep and broad concept among Moslems which addresses the question
of right and wrong about everything and about all aspects of life.
Purpose and meaning of life could well be understandings of what should be Halaal and what should be Haraam.
Trying to stick to halaal in action could well become life’s primary challenge.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec180" Halaal: the Native Context-->
<h2 id="sec180" class="section">12.4  Halaal: the Native Context</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Halaal is a word with Arabic origins. 
Halaal is a word with Islamic origins. </p><p>In Arabic and in Persian/Farsi 
the word halaal has several contexts and usages.
It is a pervasive concept, appearing in multiple contexts: in the form of formal decrees for what
is prohibited or permitted; in daily language as an individual statement of moral values;
in the content of proverbs and stories; and in many other usages. The particular shading
of meaning in any particular usage depends on the context and how the term is used.</p><p>For Moslems and for Iranians; language, religion, morality, economics, law, culture and
society are very intertwined. This leads to a complex model for humanity. </p><p>In contrast, the Western two layers model of law and economics is very simple. And in
that simple two layered model, one important purpose of law is to accomodate economics. In the
spirit of combating west-toxication «غرب زدگی», [<a href="#Repub-120024"></a>], Imam Khomeini, captured
this difference in a short crisp sentence: “basis of everything for the donkey too is its economics” – «الاغ هم زیربنای همه چیزش اقتصادش
است». <sup><a id="text10" href="#note10">1</a></sup>
The word
and concept of halaal is clearly non-essential for simple economic creatures.</p><p>Right and wrong are often orthogonal to economics and profit, as externality is an
inherent characteristic of economics.</p><p>To pay lip service to any remaining human needs of economic creatures, individualism and
individualistic freedom becomes the main pillar of Western morality. Conveniently, the
Western economics model celebrates individual freedoms. Based on those individualistic
freedoms, the sophisticated Western corporation is then well positioned to manipulate the
naive Western individual. With that form of Western morality in place, the Western
corporation then demands those individualistic freedoms for itself. The American/Western
legal system then kicks in and formalizes the Western legal notions of “corporate
personhood”. The Western model then amounts to a complete collection of economic
creatures (people and corporations alike). Should such a collection be called a society?
What is Western society?</p><p>The span of the word halaal does include the individual’s freedom. Halaal subsumes freedom.
The concept of halaal is far broader and far stronger than freedom. 
The span of the word halaal in Persian and in the Shia tradition and in the Iranian
culture is illustrated below with five examples:</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Religious Decree:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> One of the purposes of religion is to declare “rights” and “wrongs”.
In Islam that is accomplished with Halaal and Haraam declarations. <p>For example, consider the following.</p><blockquote class="quote">
“Gambling is haraam”          «قمار حرام است» 
</blockquote><p>Here we have Islam, in its entirety, explicitly declaring that gambling is wrong and prohibited.</p></dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Fatwa by your Source-of-Imitation:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> One of the responsibilities of one’s
source-of-imitation «مرجع تقلید» is to figure the ethics and morality
of new complex topics and provide Halaal and Haraam declarations for his followers and
on behalf of society. Very often societal consensus and source-of-imitation’s
declaration are consistent. In such cases, the source-of-imitation’s declaration is still
extremely important as it seals societal consensus.<p>For example, consider the following fatwa by Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei.</p><blockquote class="quote">

«آیت اللّه العظمی علی خامنه‌ای، رهبر ایران، در سال ۲۰۰۵ طی فتوایی سلاح های اتمی را حرام اعلام کردند»

<p>“In 2005, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei, Iran’s leader, issued a fatwa declaring 
nuclear weapons haraam.”
</p></blockquote><p>The full relevant text in Globish is on Ayatollah Khamenei’s web site at:<br>
<a href="http://english.khamenei.ir//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1442&Itemid=13"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://english.khamenei.ir//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1442&amp;Itemid=13</span></a></p><p>It includes the following:</p><blockquote class="quote">
We believe that using nuclear weapons is haraam and prohibited and that it is
everybody’s duty to make efforts to protect humanity against this great disaster.
</blockquote><p>Such a declaration by the Iranian leader, using this most strong word
“Haraam”, is in stark contrast with America’s actual use of nuclear weapons, its
threats of re-using it in the form of “all options are on the table” and the American
belief system of: “might makes right”. </p><p>Were Halaal and Haraam on the table when in August 1945, on American leader’s (Truman’s)
orders, two atomic bombs were dropped on Japanese civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki?</p><p>The significance of Iran’s leader, a Grand Ayatollah, to have declared nuclear weapons
haraam seems not to have been understood by Westerners.</p><p>If the Westerner’s lack of understanding of halaal and haraam plays a role in the
failure of dialog between Iran and the West, perhaps this essay can prove useful in that
regard.</p></dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Societal Consensus:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> In addition to religious decrees and fatwas by
sources-of-imitation, the society through consensus can provide halaal and haraam
declarations.<p>Consider the following example.</p><blockquote class="quote">
“One’s manner of earning a living must be halaal.”          «نان حلال خوردن»
</blockquote><p>Here we have a usage of halaal which is more in the context of society and culture.
Where halaal as a label is applied to income.</p></dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">An Individual and Her God:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <p>In a popular song, Hayedeh «هایده» sings:<br>

«خدایا امشب این می را حلالم کن، حلالم کن»

<p>“God, tonight make this wine be halaal for me. Make it be halaal for me.”
</p></blockquote><p>Here we have usage of the word halaal in context of the relationship between an
individual and her God – which need not even be necessarily all that religious.</p></dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">A Mother’s Ultimate Threat:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <p>A mother’s most severe threat to her child may take the form of:</p><blockquote class="quote">

</p></blockquote><p>This is a common saying in Farsi that often occurs between good friends when they say
good bye to one another for an extended period of time.</p><p>Here we have a usage of halaal that is completely outside of religion.
It can be used by non-Moslems and is purely cultural.
Here the Armenian and Jew’s exchange is rooted in their use of Farsi and
their being Iranians.</p></dd></dl><p>In the above examples halaal and haraam include two distinct contexts. One is the context
of manifestation of moral sensibilities and the other is the context of permissibility of
actions.</p><p>Islamic law is rooted in actions. In the context of permissibility of actions, five categories 
(a pentad –«الأحكام الخمسة»)
are enumerated:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
 واجب / فرض  (farḍ/wājib) - Compulsory – obligatory, necessary.
</li><li class="li-enumerate"> مستحب  (mustaḥabb) - Recommended.
</li><li class="li-enumerate"> مباح  (mubāḥ) - Permitted – neither obligatory, recommended, nor disliked – neutral.
</li><li class="li-enumerate"> مكروه  (makrūh) - Discouraged – abstaining is recommended.
</li><li class="li-enumerate"> حرام  (ḥarām) - Forbidden – opposite of  «واجب / فرض»  wājib, Compulsory – abstaining is obligatory.
</li></ol><p>Halaal’s context of manifestation of moral sensibilities is associated with (mubāḥ –
Permitted) «مباح»  context of permissibility of actions. Haraam’s
context of manifestation of moral sensibilities is associated with (ḥarām –
Forbidden) «حرام»  context of permissibility of actions – note the two
different senses of the single word ḥarām in the different contexts.</p><p>The scope, span and depth of halaal is far broader than its common
simplistic Western translation of “permissible in Islam” or its limited parallels with
the Jewish Kosher in the context of properness and conformity.</p><p>The intertwined nature of language, religion, morality, economics, law, culture and
society for Moslems leads to uses of halaal and haraam where the source of declaration and
the manner of declaration need not always be totally clear. Aside from religious
authority, power of the word halaal can be based on its widespread acceptance and may be
rooted in logic, persuasion and consensus.</p><p>In all the above examples, the word halaal functions as a facility for declamatory expression
of moral values. It is this general concept that is at the heart of the word halaal.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec181" Philosophical Halaal: a Wordly Framing-->
<h2 id="sec181" class="section">12.5  Philosophical Halaal: a Wordly Framing</h2><!--SEC END --><p>The word halaal is loaded in many ways. It carries a number of strong connotations, in
both its native context, and in non-native contexts. In its roots it is theological,
originating in and tied directly to Islam. It is a
sensitive word in its native context (Arabic and/or Islamic cultures), and evokes strong
reactions in the West.</p><p>In a non-native context the word halaal evokes negative reactions. In particular it is
viewed as a direct expression of Islam; at best unwelcome and at worst evoking strong
feelings of Islamophobia.</p><p>But in this essay we are using this term without these theological/Islamic
connotations. 
The scope of the
word here is philosophical and wordly, to be used in day-to-day affairs, including those of business
and technology. We are using it as a philosophical term, to address worldly concerns.
</p><p>Thus we are introducing a new context for this word, without the native Islamocentrism,
and without the non-native Islamophobia.</p><p>We considered the word secular as an appropriate qualifier, as in “secular halaal,” but this is not correct for
our purposes. Secular implies a complete separation from Islamic/theological meaning, but we wish
to retain a reference to these theological origins. Thus we are shifting the center of
gravity of the word from theological to wordly, but retaining the origins of the concept
as a theological formulation of morality. Thus we are coining the terms “philosophical
halaal” and “abstract halaal” to represent this.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec182" Philosophical Halaal: the General Concept-->
<h2 id="sec182" class="section">12.6  Philosophical Halaal: the General Concept</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Here we provide an overview description of halaal. We will then follow with a more
rigorous dialectical definition.</p><p>The word halaal has several contexts and usages. Generally speaking one can say it is a
term for the declamatory expression of moral values. </p><p>The word halaal is a facility for expressing general moral sensibilities which map to
“right.” The word haraam is a facility for expressing general moral sensibilities which
map to “wrong.”</p><p>In order for the above to be meaningful we need a framework for moral philosophy in the
abstract.</p>

<h2 id="sec183" class="section">12.7  Locating an Abstract Moral Philosophy for Expressing Philosophical Halaal</h2><!--SEC END --><p>The Western model has produced its own brand of philosophers and ethicists. Various of
these have produced frameworks and structures that come close to recognizing the need for
halaal and haraam. For example, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill (and others) have put
forward the ethical theories of Utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is an effort to provide an
answer to the practical question “What ought a man to do?” It goes towards rightness and
wrongness analysis and the greater good, but does not quite reach the point where the need
for the concepts and the words halaal and haraam become obvious. Another Western example
is Kantian ethics. Kant gets to principle of Universalizability and laws of hypothetical
kingdoms but does not recognize that he is actually searching for the concepts of
halaal and haraam.</p><p>From the perspective of those for whom halaal is a natural part of their language and
their culture, such Western philosophers and ethicists are not playing with a full
deck. Lacking the essential concept of halaal, Western philosophers are benighted without
it, and so they flounder when trying to come to grips with moral questions.</p><p>To express philosophical halaal we are not going to use any of the well-known existing
models. Instead we will use a set of precise abstractions presented by a fellow electrical
engineer.
A Western colleague and friend, Dr. Andrew Hammoude, has written an essay which provides a good
basis for explicit definition of philosophical halaal. 
</p><p>Hammoude’s essay is titled <em>Moral Philosophy: An Abstract
Approach</em> [<a href="#PLPC-150020"></a>]. The full text of his essay is

he has created is a useful basis for the definition of philosophical halaal.</p><p>In this essay we are using
Hammoude’s work extensively. Here we will restate the
key ideas, definitions and vocabulary from his essay. For complete details, refer to the
original essay titled, <em>Moral Philosophy: An Abstract Approach</em>.</p><p>The present essay is completely separate and independent from Dr. Hammoude’s work.
</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec184" Definition of an Abstract Morality-->
<h2 id="sec184" class="section">12.8  Definition of an Abstract Morality</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Hammoude defines something he calls an <em>abstract morality</em>. This is a completely
artificial construct, making no formal reference to real-world moral concepts, but it
provides a framework and a way of thinking about moral constructs. His definition is as
follows:</p><blockquote class="quote">
An <span style="font-weight:bold">abstract morality</span> is a mapping from the <em>set of actions</em> into the
two-element abstract set {<em>right</em>, <em>wrong</em>}.
</blockquote><p>The set of actions consists of all actions that may be considered to have moral
consequence; that is, they are all actions that affect the welfare of others in some
respect. The two-element set {<em>right</em>, <em>wrong</em>} is a pair of symbolic tokens
with no meaning assigned to them—they are merely arbitrary tokens that we may associate
with actions. Thus an abstract morality as defined by Hammoude is a function from the set
of actions into this pair of token symbols.</p><p>The token words <em>right</em> and <em>wrong</em> are distinct from the natural language terms
“right” and “wrong.” To distinguish the two pairs of words clearly the abstract terms
are written italicized, while the natural language terms are written unitalicized, and
frequently within quotation marks.</p><p>Refer to his essay for complete discussion and examples.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec185" Vocabulary for Real-World Morality-->
<h3 id="sec185" class="subsection">12.8.1  Vocabulary for Real-World Morality</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Hammoude also establishes a vocabulary to make reference to moral constructs in the real
world. He defines a number of terms for this purpose: an “individual moral sensibility”
referring to individual persons, an analogous “group moral sensibility” referring to
groups of individuals, a “manifestation” of such sensibilities, and a “real-world
morality,” defined in terms of such manifestations.</p><p>We summarize his definitions below:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">An <span style="font-weight:bold">individual moral sensibility</span> is defined as “an innate sense
of aversion by an individual to certain kinds of behaviour, or to the
commission of certain acts.”</li><li class="li-itemize">A <span style="font-weight:bold">group moral sensibility</span> is defined as an analogous concept for groups of
individuals; it is a cultural formulation of sensibility, representative of the majority
individual sensibilities within the group.</li><li class="li-itemize">Hammoude notes that these
sensibilities have externally observable “manifestations,” and he gives a number of
examples of this, including, “avoidance or relative rarity of acts or behaviour that
offend the sensibility; explicit verbal expression such as the use of natural language
terms like “right” and “wrong” to acts or forms of behaviour that do or do not
offend the sensibility; strong forces of dissuasion against offending acts or behaviour;
and explicit codifications of the sensibility in the form of religious or legal
doctrine.”</li><li class="li-itemize">He then defines the <span style="font-weight:bold">real-world morality</span> associated with a moral sensibility
as “a data set, consisting of the set of actions, and for each element in the set of
actions, the set of all manifestations of the sensibility regarding that action.” Thus
a morality is the complete characterization or cataloging of an underlying moral
sensibility, in terms of its observable manifestations.</li></ul>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec186" Duality between abstract and real-world moralities-->
<h3 id="sec186" class="subsection">12.8.2  Duality between abstract and real-world moralities</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Having defined an abstract morality, and a real-world morality, Hammoude then notes that
there is a duality between these two constructs, stating as follows:</p><blockquote class="quote">
For any abstract morality we define, there is a real-world morality that may exist, or
that we can imagine. And for any real-world morality, we can define a corresponding
abstract morality. Thus every abstract morality has a real-world counterpart, or
doppelganger, and <em>vice versa</em>.
</blockquote>
<!--TOC section id="sec187" Defining Abstract Halaal and Abstract Haraam-->
<h2 id="sec187" class="section">12.9  Defining Abstract Halaal and Abstract Haraam</h2><!--SEC END --><p>This now provides the framework and vocabulary needed to define
philosophical halaal. In particular, we have definitions for following
terms:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
The two-element set {<em>right</em>, <em>wrong</em>}
</li><li class="li-itemize">The set of actions
</li><li class="li-itemize">A mapping
</li><li class="li-itemize">A moral sensibility
</li><li class="li-itemize">A manifestation
</li><li class="li-itemize">An abstract morality
</li></ul><p>Note that these definitions span both 
abstract morality and real-world morality contexts.
In particular,
the <em>right</em> and <em>wrong</em> definitions taken from abstract morality
remain purely symbolic.</p><p>Based on this, we now can properly introduce the concepts of philosophical halaal and
philosophical haraam.</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold">Philosophical halaal</span> is “manifestation” of “moral sensibilities” relevant to
a specific topic where “the set of actions” map to “<em>right</em>.”</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold">Philosophical haraam</span> is “manifestation” of “moral sensibilities” relevant to
a specific topic where “the set of actions” map to “<em>wrong</em>.”</p><p>Philosophical halaal and haraam can then be applied to different topics, providing in
large part an abstract morality.</p><p>Abstract halaal and haraam are powerful enough concepts to become basis of defining one’s
religion – separate from God and even without a name.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec188" Uses Of Halaal As Labels-->
<h2 id="sec188" class="section">12.10  Uses Of Halaal As Labels</h2><!--SEC END --><p>In addition to the description of an act as halaal or haraam, halaal and haraam 
are also used as labels.</p><p>For example amongst Moslems, a well known usage of halaal as a label is “Halaal Meat”, where a specific
manner-of-existence of meat is considered halaal. This halaal manner-of-existence of meat
demands respect for the animal, engagement of the creator at the time of killing of the
animal by the human and demands prevention of such a delicate act becoming industrial.</p><p>This topic’s equivalent in the American and Western cultures is driven by efficiency and
econmics leading to Food Inc., [<a href="#FoodInc"></a>]. Where the animal becomes just a commodity.</p><p>The label of Halaal in “Halaal Meat” communicates a great deal in a single word.
It demands adherence to specific processes and rituals – specific to the animal.
It is not a single act or a single aspect of meat that makes it “Halaal Meat”.
It is the entirety of the specific process that warrants use of the lable.
That specific full process is of course well defined.</p><p>Uses of halaal as labels are equally applicable in the context of abstract (philosophical)
halaal. 
Throughout this document and elsewhere, we make use of capitalized Halaal/Haraam when we
are refering to use of these words as labels. When we are refering to the concept of
halaal/haraam we use the uncapitalized form.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec189" Authority For Halaal and Haraam Declarations And Role Of Religions-->
<h2 id="sec189" class="section">12.11  Authority For Halaal and Haraam Declarations And Role Of Religions</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Early in our exposition of the concept of halaal and haraam, very deliberately, we
divorced halaal and haraam from its religious origins. We now want to revisit the role and
place of halaal and haraam in religions and the place of religions with regard to halaal
and haraam.</p><p>Uses and introductions of halaal and haraam by individuals here and there are of some
importance and significance. But, it is broad consensus and widespread acceptance of
halaal and haraam that results in significant moral impact.</p><p>How are we to arrive at that broad consensus and widespread acceptance? </p><p>In the West, people attempt at expressing their take on right and wrong and all of that
right and wrong becomes quickly irrelevant when economics comes into the picture – as
economics is the center of the Western model. So, for the most part, halaal and
haraam are academic and anecdotal in the West.</p><p>To the extent that religions can be considered vehicles for promotion of morality and
ethics, based on their track record; a religion can be considered weaker or stronger
compared to another religion.</p><p>Church and State were easily separated in the West as Christianity
is a weak religion.
Christianity draws a clear separation between the two worlds and the two times. 
The Western Christian model has become very “Secular” now.
The
definition of the purely Western word and the concept of “Secular” by Webster is:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Of or pertaining to this present world, or to things not
spiritual or holy; relating to temporal as distinguished
from eternal interests; not immediately or primarily
respecting the soul, but the body; worldly.
</blockquote><p>In that simple Western Christian model, the Church is in control of the other world
(heaven and hell) and the State is in control of this world. And the State quickly boils
down to economics and the Corporation.</p><p>The concepts of halaal and haraam are totally absent in Christianity. Christianity does
not concern itself much with this world.</p><p>Westerners consider their idea of separation of church and state as prescriptive.
They believe that their notion of church applies to all religions and 
that their concept of religion emanating from Christianity is universal.
The concept of separation of religion and state is in no way universal. </p><p>Unlike Christianity, Islam is a strong religion which concerns itself fully with both
worlds. The founding fathers of the Islamic Republic were quite familiar with the West’s
history of the Dark Ages. Those who wrote the Islamic Republic’s constitution had read the
French and the American constitution and were familiar with the lessons of the French and
the American revolution. The founding fathers of the Islamic Republic 
fully understood the Western concepts of separation of church and state
and they fully rejected these concepts.</p><p>The model of fusing Islam and the Republic is complex and powerful. It is only such a
model that can preserve humanity and it is only this model that can stand against the
Western model of economic creatures calling their collection a society.</p><p>Halaal and haraam are of this world. Halaal and haraam are for this world. Only a
religion that fully concerns itself with both worlds can properly drive forward, Halaals
and Haraams. Secular Western and Christianic models of focusing on each of the two worlds
separately, at best will result into highly diluted Halaals and Haraams.</p><p>In the Moslem model, declarations of halaal and haraam by sources of imitation play an
important role in moving society forward as new topics for Halaal and Haraam arise.</p><p>For example, towards societal consensus on halaal manner-of-existence of software,
consider Imam Khomeini’s fatwa on invalidity of Western Intellectual Property Rights regime
which has paved the way towards current sources of imitation digesting the software
engineering profession’s definition of halaal manner-of-existence of software.</p><p>Consensus amongst Moslem sources of imitation in recognizing halaal
manner-of-existence of software and halaal manner-of-existence of internet services can
result in significant moral impact towards preventing the harm that the current disastrous Western
model of manner-of-existence of software and internet services are headed for.</p>

<h2 id="sec190" class="section">12.12  Putting Abstract Halaal To Good Use</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Globish is often primarily thought of as language of global trade and global business. On
some topics, Globish needs to also be the language for consensus towards common morality.</p><p>With a proper description of abstract halaal and haraam in place, we now encourage you to
use these in Globish and in your native language.</p><p>If a certain aspect of your profession puts you in a position, ahead of the rest of
society, to see a need for specific considerations of halaal and haraam; bring them up and
move towards defining those. Try to build consensus on those halaal labels. Have those who have
authority for halaal and haraam declarations, consider use of the labels.</p><p>Our motivation in writing this essay has been to facilitate better discussions of global

<a id="chap:DigitalNon-ProprietaryMovements"></a>

</p><p>Through out our discourse, we have been emphasizing some key points. These include:
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
For progress of arts and sciences, the natural
collaborative model of polyexistentials is superior to
the artificial competitive environment that Western IPR creates.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Professions have guardianship responsibilities to
societies. Professions should be empowered to fulfill
those responsibilities.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Humans are more than economic creatures.
</li></ul><p>While it is true that Westerners in general and Americanists in
particular don’t take the above key concepts seriously, some
individuals and some groups in Western societies intuitively get
those concepts. Clearly, not all Americanists are pure economic
creatures.</p><p>These individuals and these groups have come up with various ways
of creating collaborative environments within the Western IPR
framework. Startegies for accomplishing this spans copyright and
patent law in one dimension and content, software and services in
another dimension. All of this has a short history that spans
only about 40 years or so.</p><p>With respect to copyright, the strategy revolves around the
notion of public licenses where authors grant certain permissions
and impose certain restrictions on the public use of content,
software and services through the copyright law. This way authors
apply their chosen public licenses to their work. Tens of
such public licenses exist and various factions and cults have
been created around these public licenses each representing
certain beliefs and characters. All of this has resulted into
creation of a great deal of very valuable non-proprietary
software and content which now exists in the collaborative
environment.</p><p>With respect to patents, things are more complicated. Several
anti-patent strategies are in practice. Some, simply don’t patent
their inovations and their inventions are naturally public. Some,
publish their inovations without regard to patents, such
publications then become prior art. Some, obtain patents with the
intention of never asserting — in theory this prevents others
from obtainings the same. Some, sabotage patent applications of
large corporations from within. Some patent-assassins function as
expert witnesses in defense of patent assertions. Some, watch
over the Standards Essential Patent processes. In the larger
picture, none of these have had material impact.</p><p>Those Westerners who point to the incredible accomplishments of
the open-source movement through open-source public licenses
should ask themseleves, what if polyexistentials were governed
properly to begin with.
What if there was just one Libre-Halaal
public software license? What if there was no public proprietary
software? What if society was aligned with Libre-Halaal software?</p><p>In Section <a href="#NOTYET">??</a>, we provide
explicit definitions that address these what-ifs.
What we have in the ad hoc open-source model is a small fraction
of what we should be having.</p><p>We have structured this section in 3 parts.</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">

promotes internally opaque and proprietary outcomes that are the
result of commercial competition.</p><p>Advocates of Western IPR believe that software engineers will produce
better and more software in a proprietary and closed and competitive
(not collaborative) environment because of the resulting economic rewards.</p><p>Those rejecting Western IPR believe that software engineers produce
better and more software in a non-proprietary and open and
collaborative environment.</p><p>Those who produce software know that software is inherently
collaborative and cumulative. It has long been obvious to them as to
which model is correct and superior.</p><p>Today, the overwhelming majority of internet infrastructure runs
on non-proprietary software.</p><p>In the realm of software, there is no debate. The Libre-Halaal model
is superior to the Western IPR based Proprietary-Haraam model.</p><p>For software, the Libre-Halaal model has defeated the
Proprietary-Haraam model in the West despite of the fact that all
Western structures have been favoring the Western IPR based
Proprietary-Haraam model. Just imagine what the success of the
Libre-Halaal model if societal structures were in its favor — not
opposing it.</p><p>Because software is a pure form of polyexistentials and because

<a id="sec:SoftwarePublicLicenses"></a>
</p><p>The various above mentioned engineering movements have produced a
good number of Software Public Licenses. Broadly speaking these
licenses fall into two categories. One category is typically
called “Copyleft”, the other category is typically called
“Permissive”. Copyleft licenses attempt to keep the source code
of the software perpetually open. Permisive licenses only require
that original source code of the software be open.</p><p>Copyleft licenses are associated with the free software movement.
Permissive licenses are associated with the open-source movement.</p><p>Earlier versions of Copyleft licenses,
for example GNU General Public License, version 2 (GPLv2),
had various loopholes. We discuss these loopholes in
Section <a href="#NOTYET">??</a>.</p><p>In the context of mapping of copyright based software public
licenses to governance of proper manner-of-existence of software
as a polyexistentals, we only consider one license. That one
license is: Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPLv3).</p><p>From our perspective, in a civilized and just society all
software will be governed by the equivalent of the single AGPLv3
license. For us, the label of “Libre-Halaal Software” maps into
the AGPLv3 of Software Public Licenses. See Section <a href="#NOTYET">??</a>.</p>

After rejecting the Western IPR regime, our focus should become

Global collaborative software and internet services development
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Guardianship of society by the software engineering profession 
</li></ol><p>In opposition to the Western IPR regime, there has been various
attempts at creating global collaborative software and internet
services development models. But, the need for guardianship of
society by the software engineering profession has never been
recognized in the West.</p><p>Free and open-source software (F/OSS, FOSS) or
free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS) is software that is both
free and open source. It is liberally licensed to grant users the
right to use, copy, study, change, and improve its design through
the availability of its source code. In the context of free and
open-source software, free refers to the freedom to copy and
re-use the software, rather than to the price of the software.</p><p>The Western FOSS Movement has produced the GNU/Linux operating
system and has demonstrated the viability of free software as a
development model for creating large-scale, complex, relevant
software systems. GNU/Linux is a fully viable free software
alternative to the proprietary Microsoft Windows operating
system, against which it continues to make steady inroads.
And apart from such well-known and high-profile
projects, behind the scenes the free software movement has become
a flourishing creative environment, generating a constant stream
of new and better software packages, duplicating and surpassing
the capabilities of an ever-increasing portion of proprietary
software territory.</p><p>FOSS is rooted in Western values of liberty and individuality. Free software focuses on
the philosophical freedoms it gives to users, whereas open source software focuses on the
perceived strengths of its peer-to-peer development model. </p><p>The Free Software and Open Source movements and their combination the Free and open-source
software (F/OSS, FOSS) or free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS) have been attempting to
address this labeling challenge. Because their philosophical and moral analysis is
shallow, all of their labels are problematic in a number of respects.</p><p>The FLOSS movement lacks deep recognition of IPR regime being just Western and does not
call for full abolishment of the IPR regime. 
The FLOSS movement lacks deep recognition of the place of
software as a special form of digital polyexistential. 
The FLOSS movement lacks deep
recognition of importance of morality and role of software engineering profession in
formulation of definitions and labels towards societal protection.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec196" Libre-Halaal Software versus Free Software-->
<h4 id="sec196" class="subsubsection">Libre-Halaal Software versus Free Software</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Richard Stallman coined the term “Free Software” in the early 1980s.
The defining criteria for free software are as follows. This is
reproduced from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</span></a>, current as
of July 2011.</p><p>
Free software is a matter of the users’ freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change
and improve the software. More precisely, it means that the program’s users have the
four essential freedoms:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
</li><li class="li-itemize">The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your
computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for
this.
</li><li class="li-itemize">The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
</li><li class="li-itemize">The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom
3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your
changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
</li></ul><p>A program is free software if users have all of these freedoms.
</p><p>This definition is concise and understandable. But it is mostly
useless. Because those freedoms don’t actually mean much to
overwhelming majority of end user. Only software engineers care
if they have access to the source code. Further, unless societal
responsibilities are on the table, even software engineers would
not care much about those freedoms. A Western software engineer who
wants to accomplish a task is not concerned about his or anybody
else’s freedom. So, he will gladly use non-free software. Sure,
between two otherwise equally good software tools, she may choose
the free one. For a given user, there is no good reason to choose
software that is worse in other ways just because it gives her
freedoms that are realy not relevant to her. <sup><a id="text14" href="#note14">4</a></sup></p><p>Several decades after promotion of the term “Free Software”,
hardly any end user has ended up caring about it. Free Software
has not managed to establish a material connection with the
American society or elsewhere. Even among engineers the
connection to Free Software is quite weak.</p><p>Some have come to conclude that from the very beginning the
politics of Free Software were ill directed. Consider this quote from Melody Horn:
</p><blockquote class="quote">
the free software movement is explicitly political, but its politics
suck. it’s a movement by and for ideological diehards but the ideology
is extremely esoteric. theirs was a losing battle from day one. so what
was it that actually killed them? i think in a very real way it was the
GPLv3.<p>... the flagship projects of the free software movement are probably Linux
and the GNU pile of tools. the Linux kernel being released under a free
software license doesn’t directly create more free software, though,
since even things that tie closely to the kernel aren’t obligated to
also be free software, and of course user-level applications can have
whatever license they want. and also most of the people using Linux
right now are using it by accident, distributed as ChromeOS or Android,
neither of which is free software. so Linux is a win for the free
software movement but a useless one.</p><p>... the free software movement, in the end, burned itself out, by fighting
for a tiny crumb of success and then turning around and lighting that
success on fire. the death of free software tells us that we can’t use a
license to trick corporations into sharing our values: they want to
profit, and if good software has a license that puts a limit on how much
they can do that, they’ll put more resources into writing their own
alternative than they would spend complying with the license in the
first place.</p></blockquote><p>Definition of Free Software is consistent with our own definition
of Libre-Halaal software.
So why have we taken the trouble to define Libre-Halaal software,
when it turns out to be mostly consistent with free software?</p><p>The reason is that the two definitions are ideologically different. They exist in
ideologically different contexts, and this ideological difference is reflected in their
phrasing.</p><p>The term “Free Software” was coined in the early 1980s in America.
Their culture and language lacked the word “Halaal”. So “Freedom” as the pinnacle of
American values became the key word. The label “Free Software” has proven problematic in
many respects. Free in English has two meanings, “gratis” and “liberty”. For the
public at large the “gratis” meaning is dominant, so the “Free Software” label never
worked well. To address this, the word “Libre” has been introduced into Globish and
“Free Software” and “Libre Software” have become synonyms. But, “Libre Software” is
also not a good label because it does not focus on the ethical, moral and societal manner
of existence of software. The focus of the label needs to be on morality and society. Once
“Halaal” is properly introduced into Globish [<a href="#PLPC-120039"></a>], the label “Libre-Halaal
Software” will prove more crisp and more on the mark.</p><p>The free software definition exists in the context of Western copyright law, and
implicitly accepts that as a reality. The key to free software is the GPL (General Public
License), a form of licensing intended to preserve the four definitional freedoms. But
this is of course a form of copyright, and so the free software definition resides within
and submits to the Western copyright conventions.</p><p>The free software definition is rooted in the context of Western values and assumptions:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
It is centered on the individual (individual freedom), as opposed to being centered
on society (ethics and morality). The concepts of profession and society are absent. The
definition is based entirely on the individual, and the individual’s freedom.
</li><li class="li-itemize">It exists in the context of the Western Copyright and Patent regime. Freedom 2 and
freedom 3 are written in response to this, and implicitly accept this as a
reality. There is is no explicit assertion that the ability to copy is a natural law and
a human right.
</li><li class="li-itemize">It does not recognize the Software Engineering profession as a guardian. Freedom 1
makes no distinction between ordinary users (i.e. almost everyone), and software
engineering professionals. The implication is that anyone can exercise freedom 1,
without need for guardianship by the Software Engineering profession.
</li></ul><p>The Libre-Halaal software definition on the other hand makes no concession whatever to Western
Intellectual Property Rights. We view the Western Intellectual Property Rights regime as a
fundamental misconception, and fundamentally invalid.</p><p>While operating in countries where Western Intellectual Property Rights regime are law of
the land and have deep roots, we subject our own work to the most stringent forms of the
General Public License that is available.</p><p>While operating in countries where Western Intellectual Property Rights regime have not
taken root or are not valid (e.g., China, Iran) we also work towards rejection and
abolishment of Western Intellectual Property Rights regime and work towards requiring that
all software entering the country and used is Halaal Software.</p>

spineless and centrist. Open source welcomes and accommodates
corporatization of FOSS. And since most Western software

is a match made in heaven and open-source has eaten the world and
Free Software has been rendered mostly irrelevant.</p>

from running modified versions of the software on that hardware. This is in reference to
circumstances such as TiVo’s use of GNU GPL licensed software on the TiVo brand digital
video recorders (DVR).</p><p>In such cases the spirit of halaal software is circumvented by exploiting holes in the
underlying copyleft license.</p><p>So while TiVo has complied with the GPL v2 requirement to release the source code for
others to modify, any modified software will not run on TiVo’s hardware. GPL v3 attempts
to plug that hole in the context of Wester IPR regime.</p><p>Note that this form of bastardization leads outside of software as a pure polyexistential

Support For FOSS Software Revenue
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Grants, Fund Raising And Non-Proprietary Research and Development Organizations
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Libre Services Repeatable Subscription Fees

<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec204" Revenues From Support For FOSS Software-->
<h4 id="sec204" class="subsubsection">Revenues From Support For FOSS Software</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Proprietary software almost always comes with support from its
owner. In the proprietary model the software license is very
often bundled with support. Since FOSS’s model is
non-proprietary, unowned and very often non-commercial, the
paradigm for support is different.</p><p>As early as 1989, a small company called “Cygnus Support”
started providing commercial support for free software. Its
tagline was: “Making free software affordable”. About 10 years
later Cygnus merged with Red Hat. The business model for
providing commercial support for FOSS is simple. Large
organizations often use a great deal of FOSS and when they do,
they need support. The support business arrangements are
typically in the form of retainers, consulting and subscriptions
for orderly updates.</p><p>In due course the scope of software support grew to the totality
of operating system distributions and now Red Hat is mostly
associated with its enterprise operating system: Red Hat
Enterprise. In parallel with Red Hat, Canonical provides
enterprise support for Ubuntu (a Debian derivative).</p><p>This type of commercial support for enterprises (large
corporations) has impacted evolution of FOSS. More emphasis is
placed on developement and cultivation of the type of software
that large organizations use and need. Many of these large
organizations operate inside of the Surveillance Capitalism
model. As a result evolution of FOSS has been skewed towards
central large scale corporate oriented software and systems.</p><p>The business of support for FOSS, in the non-proprietary
for-profit quadrant can be lucrative but it is not as repeatable
and as profitable as proprietary business in the business of
support for FOSS, in the proprietary for-profit quadrant.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec205" Grants, Fund Raising And Non-Proprietary Research Organizations-->
<h4 id="sec205" class="subsubsection">Grants, Fund Raising And Non-Proprietary Research Organizations</h4><!--SEC END --><p>There are also opportunities for revenue generation in the
in the non-proprietary non-profit quadrant.</p><p>Various FOSS organizations emphasize the public good that they
are creating and engage in periodic public fund raising
campaigns. In America, many of these organizations claim to be
“freedom” oriented. We present our perspective on this topic in
Section <a href="#sec%3AACynicalPerspectiveOnFreedomOrientationOfAmericans">13.4</a>
—
sec:ACynicalPerspectiveOnFreedomOrientationOfAmericans.</p><p>In America, the public sector has not yet realized that
investements and support for non-proprietary research outside of
academic university settings can have large multiplayer effects.
This is mostly because of the strong American belief system in
their IPR regime. Europeans have invested more heavily in this.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec206" Libre Services Repeatable Subscription Fees-->
<h4 id="sec206" class="subsubsection">Libre Services Repeatable Subscription Fees</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The IPR system has created an environment in which the revenue
models of non-propietary (FOSS) software are at a disadvantage
compared to the revenue models of propietary software.
However, this does not have to be the case for
the revenue models of internet application services.</p><p>Thus far, FOSS movement has failed to extend its defintions to
the internet application services realm. The definitions of Libre
Services as we describe them in Section <a href="#NOTYET">??</a> —
NOTYET — are not widely understood.</p><p>At present, there is no clear distinction between proprietary internet
application services (Proprietary Services) and Libre-Halaal internet
application services (Libre Services).</p><p>Extending FOSS into Libre Services should become the primary
focus of the business and economics of FOSS.</p><p>Libre Services can compete very well against Proprietary
Services. In the internet application services domain they are
both at equal footing. They both have the repeatability
attribute. It is true that with Libre Services the competetive
barrier to entry is lower, but on the other hand the
collaborative development results are more advantageous.</p><p>In 2021, we tried to persuade Mark Shuttleworth, the president of
Canonical (Ubuntu) to shift the focus from software and support
services to FOSS based consumer oriented internet application
services (Libre Services). Below is part of a related email exchange.</p><p>The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem mentioned in this email

</blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>...</p><p>Hi Mark,
...</p><p>Consider what is below as unsolicited feedback
about my read on what you have been publicly doing
with Ubuntu and Canonical.</p><p>Edwards Deming said:<br>
 "A system can not understand itself. The
transformation requires a view from outside."</p><p>The short version of my feedback is:</p><p>** The competition between Debian and Ubuntu is no
longer necessary and productive. The split and
having a choice is no longer positive.</p><p>** You should reposition Ubuntu-Server to become a
layer on top of Debian-Server – not parallel
to it. Package whatever you want and load it on
top of Debian and call it say,
"Debuntu". Provide commercial support services
for pure Debian and for Debuntu. You will
increase your corporate customer base and you
would better compete against RedHat.</p><p>** Keep Ubuntu-Desktop as is. But in addition to
Ubuntu-Desktop also provide a
Debuntu-Desktop. A Debuntu-Desktop boots as a
Debian-Desktop and then becomes the equivalent
of Ubuntu-Desktop.</p><p>Consider the default inclusion of Debian in all
Chromebooks. That is a big deal!
Debuntu-Desktop strategy as a layer on top (as
opposed to in parallel) can keep Ubuntu
relevant in such situations. Just that in and
of itself, justifies this strategy.</p><p>** Focus on building a large scale end-user
oriented internet service which can also be
self-hosted. Let’s call it "Canonical
Autonomy-oriented Internet Services (CAIS)" –
for now. This is why I had sent you the ByStar
information. ByStar can be the beginnings of
CAIS. The initial large scale internet service
should focus on email and web-publication.
Because of the possibility of running a native
MUA (as opposed to being just browser based),
you should be able to do better that GMail –
yet autonomous. The user experience can be
superb because you would be in full control of
the software-service continuum. The focus of
the initial large scale internet service should
be artists – writers, musicians, photographers
and movie makers. They would self-publish. And
you would take care of their syndication and
search ...</p><p>** Create a rich software-service continuum
between Ubuntu-Desktop and CAIS. You are
uniquely positioned to do this.</p><p>** Grow Ubuntu-Desktop and CAIS together – not
independently. A new release’s goal should be
to improve the software-service continuum
end-user experience. Not to just improve one or
the other.</p><p>** Focus on harvesting as opposed to planting and
growing. You learned that through the Unity
experience. But still, with Ubuntu proper, you
can grow less and harvest more.</p><p>** ...
</p><p>** You have an image problem that you can fix.
You made your fortunes during the dotCon era.
The caricature image of a dotCon era spin and
flipper and pump and dumper who takes himself
way too seriously is attributed to you through
association. Your previous standings have
amplified that caricature.</p><p>All of that may well not be true. And if it is not
true, you should fix it through humility,
statesmanship and healing.</p><p>** Focus on healing. The Debian and Ubuntu split
is a self-inflicted wound. Make a 180 degrees
turn on that. Provide full commercial support
for Debian in large data-centers similar to the
old Cygnus model. Identify the specific profile
of apps and packages that matches your specific
software-service continuum and fund that as a
non-profit with no strings attached.</p><p>...</p><p>This question of choosing between Debian vs Ubuntu
is silly. They are fundamentally the same. If you
are in the business of making free software
affordable, why not support them both. Why not see
them as one?</p><p>...</p><p>Today, everything is about creating
software-service continuums and from that
perspective, much of your past efforts have been
ill-directed. On the end-user oriented internet
services side, Canonical is behind.</p><p>I must confess. I have not written the above just
for your benefit. If I am able to influence you in
these directions, the greater good is also served.</p><p>...</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p><p>...Mohsen

<h3 id="sec207" class="subsection">13.1.6  Corporatization Of FOSS</h3><!--SEC END --><p>In October of 1998, a number of internal Microsoft documents about
threats of FOSS to Microsoft were leaked — some refer to these as
Halloween<a id="hevea_default104"></a> documents.</p><p>These documents describe corporate thinking about FOSS and other related open
movements. Corporate response towards FOSS and other related open movements has been a
mixture of poisoning the well, joining open movements towards controlling and selective
open-source participation as a competitive strategy.</p><p>Many of these corporate strategies have produced the desired
results. For example, IETF is now fully controlled by big
corporations, so is Open Source Initiative and many others.</p><p>These strategies combined with internal FOSS dynamics have created an
environment where much software is available and is being produced but
that societal usage and directions come from big corporations — not the
engineering profession.</p><p>Melody Horn highlights this notion in her Post-Open Source post:</p><blockquote class="quote">
...<p>if there’s anything corporations love more than rewriting software so it
lets them make all the money they can dream of, it’s letting other
people do that work for them. it took a while to take off, because the
conservative approach of "keep things closed source" was pretty solidly
entrenched in a lot of places, but now even the once conservative
holdouts have accepted the gospel of centrism. corporations have little
to nothing to lose by publishing existing source code, and can gain all
sorts of unpaid volunteer labor. if they start a new internal project,
important enough that they’re prepared to put effort into it but not so
important that someone could run off with it and compete with them, then
now they’ll likely open source it. worst case scenario, they do all the
work they were already prepared to do. best case scenario, their library
turns into the single most popular library of its type, with thousands
of unpaid volunteers donating their time to you. more labor for free,
community goodwill for having started the project everybody uses, the
benefits if it goes well are countless. free software is not in
principle anti-corporate, but corporations are very cautious getting
caught up in the free software movement, because that actually creates
obligations for them. open source gives corporations a shot at improving
their code for free, so as long as they don’t share so much someone
could start a competitor, so there’s zero reason for a corporation to
not get into open source.</p><p>github itself is arguably the epitome of the open source movement. the
platform itself is closed source, because they don’t want people to
compete with them running their code, and also they sell the very
expensive self-hosted version to corporations. opening up the source for
github itself would take a chunk out of github’s profits. can’t have
that. but they don’t even need to start or adopt an open source
component to profit off other people’s labor: <em>literally every
project on github</em> makes github more valuable. popular projects get
people in, network effects bring their colleagues in, and then when it’s
time for something that you’d rather have closed source you and everyone
else are already on github so you might as well spring for the paid
tier. if they believed open source was in principle better, they’d be
open source themselves. they believe open source is profitable for them,
and corporate profit is by definition value generated by labor but not
paid to the laborer.</p><p>...</p></blockquote><p>Let’s consider Github a bit further. Github has become the
defacto international center for open-source collaboration. On January 25th,
2023, Github announced:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Today, I’m excited to share that there are now officially more
than 100 million developers using GitHub to build, maintain,
and contribute to software projects.
</blockquote><p>With respec to Github and open-source, further consider the
American and international dimensions of Github as a defacto
open-source center.</p><p>Of the 100 million Github developers, the overwhelming majority
are non-Americans <sup><a id="text15" href="#note15">5</a></sup>. Yet, Github is owned by Micorsoft, a very
American corporation. Microsoft, has to abide by US law. More and
more frequently the US imposes sanctions on various countries and
various people. So, here we have large numbers of people engaging
in open-source under the surveillance of Microsoft and at the
merci of US government. This is not theoretical, it has happened.
For a while, Gitlab (a Github competitor) failed to obtain proper
sanction exemption for Iran and hundreds of open-source
developers could no longer access their own software from Iran.</p><p>At this point, American corporatization of FOSS can be considered
comprehensive. Free Software ideology has proven irrelevant and
corporatized open-source is the defacto model. Many Western FOSS
software engineers regard all of this as a fine cozy
relationship.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec208" Open-Source Development As Surrogate Activity-->
<h3 id="sec208" class="subsection">13.1.7  Open-Source Development As Surrogate Activity</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Over time corporations and the overwhelming majority of FOSS
software engineers have come to a convenient consensus that
allows for FOSS as a surrogate activity.</p><p>First let’s clarify as what we mean by “surrogate” activity.
For clarification, consider the entirety of paragraphs 39 and 40
of the 1995 Unabomber’s Manifesto: “Industrial Society and Its
Future” [<a href="#XX"></a>].</p><blockquote class="quote"><p>39. We use the term “surrogate activity” to designate
an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that
people set up for themselves merely in order to have some
goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the qake
of the “fulfillment” that they get from pursuing the goal.
Here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities.
Given a person who devotes much time
and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask yourself this: If
he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying
his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use
his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way,
would he feel seriously deprived because he did
not attain goal X? If the answer is no, then the person’s
pursuit of goal X is a surrogate activity. Hirohito’s studies
in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity,
since it is pretty certain that if Hirohito had had to spend
his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order
to obtain the necessities of life, he would not have
felt deprived because he didn’t know all about the anatomy
and life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand
the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate
activity, because most people, even if their existence
were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they
passed their lives without ever having a relationship with
a member of the opposite sex. (But pursuit of an excessive
amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a
surrogate activity.)</p></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>40. In modern industrial society only minimal effort
is necessary to satisfy one’s physical needs. It is enough
to go through a training program to acquire some petty
technical skill, then come to work on time and exert the
very modest effort needed to hold a job. The only requirements
are a moderate amount of intelligence and, most
of all, simple OBEDIENCE. If one has those, society takes
care of one from cradle to grave. (Yes, there is an underclass
that cannot take the physical necessities for granted,
but we are speaking here of mainstream society.) Thus it
is not surprising that modern society is full of surrogate
activities. These include scientific work, athletic achievement,
humanitarian work, artistic and literary creation,
climbing the corporate ladder, acquisition of money and
material goods far beyond the point at which they cease
to give any additional physical satisfaction, and social activism
when it addresses issues that are not important for
the activist personally, as in the case of white activists who
work for the rights of nonwhite minorities. These are not
always PURE surrogate activities, since for many people
they may be motivated in part by needs other than the
need to have some goal to pursue. Scientific work may be
motivated in part by a drive for prestige, artistic creation
by a need to express feelings, militant social activism by
hostility. But for most people who pursue them, these activities
are in large part surrogate activities. For example,
the majority of scientists will probably agree that the “ful-fillment”
they get from their work is more important than
the money and prestige they earn.</p></blockquote><p>Adopting Theodore Kaczynski’s terminology, FOSS activity for most
software engineers is a “surrogate” activity.</p><p>The typical open-source developer does not really care and is perfectly willing to
subject his code to what is most convenient for his current or future employer.</p><p>So, ethical licenses are out and corporate friendly permisive
licenses are in. The profession of software engineering is
rendered irrelevant and economic creatures govern through economics.</p><p>Of course, what claim above is not scientific. It is very
difficult to understand why people engage in the types of
activities that they do. Some research and experimentation has
been done in the area of understanding the motivations of
software developers. To be considered more scietific, let’s also
look at MIT Sloan School of Management’s 2005 research. Their
results were published in a paper titled: “Why Hackers Do What
They Do: Understanding Motivation and Effort in Free/Open Source
Software Projects”[<a href="#NOTYET"></a>]. The abstract from that paper says:
</p><blockquote class="quote">
Abstract:
In this paper we report on the results of a study of the effort and motivations of individuals to
contributing to the creation of Free/Open Source software. We used a Web-based survey,
administered to 684 software developers in 287 F/OSS projects, to learn what lies behind the
effort put into such projects. Academic theorizing on individual motivations for participating in
F/OSS projects has posited that external motivational factors in the form of extrinsic benefits
(e.g.; better jobs, career advancement) are the main drivers of effort. We find in contrast, that
enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation, namely how creative a person feels when working on the
project, is the strongest and most pervasive driver. We also find that user need, intellectual
stimulation derived from writing code, and improving programming skills are top motivators for
project participation. A majority of our respondents are skilled and experienced professionals
working in IT-related jobs, with approximately 40 percent being paid to participate in the F/OSS
project.
</blockquote><p>Of course, this too should not be taken too seriously. It is
likely very outdated, the survey was small and
SourceForge <sup><a id="text16" href="#note16">6</a></sup> was not and is not all that relevant.</p><p>Regardless, we believe that for most developers open-source
development is either a job or a surrogate activity.</p>

we created three categories of digitals: (1) software, (2)content and
(3) internet application services.</p><p>Software controls all forms of digital content. Development of
software is inherently collaborative and cumulative. These
attributes make software special.
The concept of software public
licensing started in the early 1980s. Use of software public
licenses were widespread by mid-1980s.</p><p>Widespread use of digital content public licenses only started in
the mid-2000s. In many ways content public licensing mimics
software public licensing.</p><p>Let’s first define what we mean by digital content. Digital
content is any content that exists in the form of digital data.
Forms of digital content include information that is digitally
broadcast, streamed, or contained in computer files. Types of
digital content include: video, audio, images and text. Broadly
speaking, digital content is anything that can be digitally
published (e. g. digitally updated weather forecasts, GPS maps,
and so on).</p><p>Use of creative common content copyright licenses have now become
widespread. According to the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses"><span style="font-family:monospace">https://creativecommons.org/licenses</span></a> web page:</p><blockquote class="quote">
The Creative Commons copyright licenses and tools forge a
balance inside the traditional “all rights reserved” setting
that copyright law creates. Our tools give everyone from
individual creators to large companies and institutions a
simple, standardized way to grant copyright permissions to
their creative work. The combination of our tools and our users
is a vast and growing digital commons, a pool of content that
can be copied, distributed, edited, remixed, and built upon,
all within the boundaries of copyright law.
</blockquote><p>Creative Commons (CC) organization has released several
copyright licenses, known as Creative Commons licenses.
These licenses allow authors of creative
works to communicate which rights they reserve and which rights
they waive for the benefit of recipients or other creators.</p><p>In the context of mapping of copyright based content public
licenses to governance of proper manner-of-existence of content as a
polyexistentals, we only consider one license.
That one license is: Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0).</p><p>From our perspective, in a civilized and just society all
content will be governed by the single CC BY-SA 4.0 license. For us,
the label of “Libre-Halaal Software” maps into the CC BY-SA 4.0 of
Software Public Licenses. See Section <a href="#NOTYET">??</a></p>
<!--TOC section id="sec210" Protocols And Standards Essential Patents-->
<h2 id="sec210" class="section">13.3  Protocols And Standards Essential Patents</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Copyright and patent work very differently.</p><p>With copyright, the author wants others to use his work but to
pay for the copy that they get. In other words, copying of the
polyexistent is prohibited. With patents, in theory, the inventor
wants to be the only one who uses the know-how to build things
without restrictions and prohibits other people to use that
know-how. The patent holder publishes the know-how and copying of
the polyexistential is not prohibited. It is the incorporation of
the know-how (as a polyexistential) in other polyexistentials or
mixed-existentials that is prohibited. If others end up using
that know-how, knowingly or unknowingly, then patent holder can
claim damages.</p><p>With copyright, the author advertises the work to make it more
popular. Or subjects his work to a public copyright license so
that more people can use it. The equivalent of public copyright
license does not apply to the patent domain. In some ways the
opposite is at work with patents. The patent holder wants others
to inadvertently use their patents and then claim damages. A
submarine patent is a patent whose issuance and publication are
intentionally delayed by the applicant for a long time. Submarine
patents stay “hidden” until the industry implements the
technology. Trolls making use of submarine patents in patent
ambushes are sometimes referred to as patent pirates. Consider
how colorfull the previous sentence was. The Western IPR system
is the source of all this waste and all this ugliness.</p><p>If a patent holder could somehow force or encourage inadvertent
use of his patent by others, the value of his patent increases.
The “somehow” in the above sentence can have the form of
applicability of the patent to a public protocol or a public standard.</p><p>An essential patent or standard-essential patent (SEP) is a
patent that claims an invention that must be used to comply with
a technical standard. Standards organizations, therefore,
often require members disclose and grant licenses to their
patents and pending patent applications that cover a standard
that the organization is developing <sup><a id="text17" href="#note17">7</a></sup>.</p><p>If a standards organization fails to get licenses to all patents
that are essential to complying with a standard, owners of the
unlicensed patents may demand or sue for royalties from companies
that adopt the standard. This happened for example to the JPEG
standard.</p><p>Determining which patents are essential to a particular standard
can be complex. Standardisation organizations require licences of
essential patents to be on fair, reasonable, and
non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec211" How Patents Affect Protocols-->
<h3 id="sec211" class="subsection">13.3.1  How Patents Affect Protocols</h3><!--SEC END --><p>We use the terms protocols and standards interchangeably. In the
broadest sense a protocol specifies an expected behavior and so
does a standard.</p><p>Patents are applied to software, not to protocols. It is not possible
to patent a protocol; in general only a process or an algorithm can be
patented. However, a protocol may include a patented algorithm as an
integral part of its specification. In this case, <em>any software
implementation of the protocol requires the use of patented
software</em>. That is, a patented process is an inherent part of the
protocol.</p><p>Even if a protocol does not explicitly decree the use of a specific
patented software process, it may still be the case that any practical
implementation of the protocol requires the use of patented software
components. The protocol could in principle be implemented in a way
which avoids the use of patented software; in practice, however, the
result would be a significantly inferior implementation, for example
in terms of efficiency.</p><p>In either case, the protocol effectively implies the use of patented
software. We will refer to any such protocol as a <span style="font-weight:bold">patented
protocol</span>. That is, a patented protocol is any protocol whose
practical implementation requires the use of patented software
components.</p><p>We will use the term <span style="font-weight:bold">patent-free protocol</span>, or just <span style="font-weight:bold">free
protocol</span>, to refer to a protocol which is functionally free from
software patents. By “functionally free from software patents”, we
mean either that the protocol is truly free from patents, or if the
protocol does imply the use of patented software, that the
patent-holder has granted non-restrictive rights to include the
patented software components in implementations of the protocol.</p><p>In either case, the result is that the protocol can be freely
implemented and used by anyone, without encountering significant
restrictions.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec212" Protecting Against Contamination Of Protocols By Patents-->
<h3 id="sec212" class="subsection">13.3.2  Protecting Against Contamination Of Protocols By Patents</h3><!--SEC END --><p>By the late 1990s IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) had
already been corporotized. Agents of big corporations were now
running the show. IETF is the protocols standardization
organization of internet. They had codified the rules for the
patents in protocols game. How to declare possibility of patent
contamination were codified. And grants of FRAND patent licenses
were codified.</p><p>There after every standard organization started to mimic the IETF
and they sprinkled some of their corporate culture values on top
of the standard-essential patent (SEP) policies and procedures.
There are now very large databases across various standardization
organizations that enumerate which patents as they may apply to
which protocols.</p><p>In the early 2000s, we suggested the idea of having a single set
of policies and procedures for dealing with the patent issues
across all standardization organizations. The concept of
separating the standards work from the work of decontamination of
patents is quite simple. We published details of this concept as:</p><blockquote class="quote">
<span style="font-weight:bold">The Free Protocols Foundation Policies and Procedures</span><br>

— [<a href="#PLPC-100201"></a>]<br>
</blockquote><p>There were no takers. Standard organizations prefer to run their
own patent game.</p><p>These patents games are very costly. Corporations in turn pass
the costs to the cosumer. The consumers are utterly unaware that
they are paying for the game. Hardly anyone dares to see that without
the patent games and without the Western IPR regime, the cosumers
are going to be much better off.</p>

<a id="sec:ACynicalPerspectiveOnFreedomOrientationOfAmericans"></a>
</p><p>The Copyright laws of the Western IPR regime with its “All
Rights Reserved” default left a vacuum. What if it was not in
the interest of the authors to keep all the rights?</p><p>As Bill Joy, the founder of Sun Microsystems, puts it,
“Sometimes when you fill a vacuum, it still sucks.”</p><p>Though his phrasing leaves much to be desired, his point is
beyond debate: even the most appalling solution is better than no
solution at all.</p><p>The concept of public licenses is what has filled that vacuum.
And much good has come as a result.
But does that really have much to do with freedom?</p><p>Freedom always makes for good hype in America.</p><p>Consider what happened in February of 2003 in a North Carolina
restaurant. Freedom fries was a politically motivated renaming of
French fries. That was then widely publicized a month later when
the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House
Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three
Congressional cafeterias. The political renaming occurred in
context of France’s opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq.</p><p>Let us consider use of the terms “free” and “freedom” by the
groups and movements that we mentioned earlier.</p><p>The leader of the Creative Commons is Lawrence Lessig.
He is the author of a book titled: “FREE CULTURE”.</p><p>The historic leader of Free Software Foundation is Richard Stallman.
He is the author of a book titled: “Free Software, Free Society”.</p><p>The historic lawyer of Free Software Foundation is Eben Moglen.
He is the founder of “Software Freedom Law Center” and a
champion of “FreedomBox”.</p><p>A historic leader of Open Source is Eric Raymond.
Prominent on his web site is: “It’s all about freedom...”</p><p>But what do these four very American white men mean by
“freedom”? The only meaningful freedom in this context is
freedom from the restrictions that Western IPR regime imposes on
societies. It would make sense to say that copyright law is a
mistake, that we want it to be abolsihed and that we want to be
<span style="font-style:italic">free</span> from the restrictions that copyright law imposes on
our societies. It would make sense to say that patent law is a
mistake, that we want it to be abolsihed and that we want to be
<span style="font-style:italic">free</span> from the restrictions that patent law imposes on
our societies.</p><p>But none of these four is speaking about that freedom.</p><p>In “FREE CULTURE”, Lawrence Lessig says:
</p><blockquote class="quote">
There are many who are skeptical of patents, especially drug
patents. I am not. Indeed, of all the areas of research that might be sup-
ported by patents, drug research is, in my view, the clearest case where
patents are needed.
</blockquote><p>Lawrence Lessig is dead wrong. As we have shown, patent law is a
mistake because polyexistentals are unownable. There is no
evidence to show that for drug research (or any type of research)
the artificially created patents-based environment is superior to
the the natural collaborative model.</p><p>The “Free” in Free Software that Richard Stallman speaks of is
about “freedom of users to inspect and modify their software
based on available source-code.” My aunt, Khaleh, had difficulty
using Windows and did not know what source-code is. The four
freedoms that Richard Stallman wants to offer my aunt are useless
and absurd. Stallman came up with those concepts long ago, when
software users were mostly engineers and scientists. So, at best,
definition of Free Software is archaic.</p><p>The freedom that Eric Raymond wants to offer is that of doing
whatever you want with the source-code. In that model any
derivative of open-source software can become closed-source
proprietary software. Was it not our goal to get away from
proprietary software? Raymond is a member of the Ameriacn
Libertarian Party and an American gun rights advocate.</p><p>Stallman has an essay titled “Why Open Source Misses the Point
of Free Software” in which he criticizes Eric Raymond’s concept
of freedom. Eric Raymond in turn has criticized Stallman’s rhetoric:</p><blockquote class="quote">
The “very seductive” moral and ethical rhetoric of Richard
Stallman and the Free Software Foundation fails, he said, “not
because his principles are wrong, but because that kind of
language … simply does not persuade anybody”.
</blockquote><p>Eben Moglen is an American lawyer, not an engineer. His champioship of
“FreedomBox” is misguided. We don’t necessary want a “Box”.
What we want is: “Possession Assertible Libre-Halaal Services”
(PALS). In software and operating systems, boxes have been
rendered irrelevant by virtualization. The option to possess,
host and materialize a PALS under one’s full control and in one’s
own home is of course fundamental. But, based on definition and
regulation, PALS can also be externally hosted. Further, the
scope of FreedomBox is overly limited. We should be targetting
the totality of a Libre-Halaal digital ecosystem.
See Chapter <a href="#NOTYET">??</a> — nameref for details of what we are suggesting.</p><p>If these four Americans really understood freedom, they would be
explicitly calling for abolishment of the Western IPR regime.
In America, very often, “freedom” hype comes with self-promotion towards
cult construction. If we were to be overly cynical, we would say:
“that is what we have here with these four Americans.”</p><p>We don’t mean to demean any of these four American gentlemen.
Their work paved the way for us having a greal deal of
non-proprietary software and non-proprietary content. This is
great! We are simply suggesting that perhaps they are conflicted.
Perhaps they have not understood the full picture in depth and
perhaps their emphasises on free and freedom is shalow.</p><p>Compare and contrast what we are saying against the American
notions of freedom.</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
We are offering the logic of the nature of
polyexistentials to establish invalidity the Western IPR regime.</li><li class="li-enumerate">We are explicitly calling for abolishment of the Western

<!--TOC chapter id="sec215" Global Polyexistential Capitalism-->
<h1 id="sec215" class="chapter">Chapter 14  Global Polyexistential Capitalism</h1><!--SEC END --><p>
<a id="chap:GlobalPolyexistentialCapitalism"></a>

</p><p>When there is one thing that can only be possessed by one possessor,
all wishing to possess that one thing must compete. Hence,
monoexistential capitalism is inherently competition oriented.</p><p>Thus far uses of the word capitalism have not been distinguishing
between monoexistential capitalism and polyexistential capitalism.
Economic models for monoexistentials and polyexistentials should be
inherently different. Because, monoexistentials lead to
mono-possessablity and clear ownership rules but polyexistentials
lead to poly-possessablity and no-ownership. Rivalry goods are rivalry
because of their monoexistence. Polyexistence naturally results in public
goods.</p><p>We are devout monoexistential bounded-corporations capitalists.
We believe in proper ownership rules, free markets and proper
regulation.</p><p>The existing capitalist model for monoexistentials is generally
correct, in both philosophical and economic terms. But the
extension of the monoexistential capitalist model into the
domain of polyexistentials, based on the Western IPR regime, is
a grave mistake. Philosophically it is wrong. Societally it is
harmful to humanity. And economically it is unstable and
vulnerable, since it can be displaced by disruptive business
models that are based on polyexistential dynamics.
We provide an example of this vulnerability in Section
 <a href="#sec%3ACaseStudy%3ATheLibre-HalaalByStarDigitalEcosystemOpenBusinessPlan">14.6</a> —
sec:CaseStudy:TheLibre-HalaalByStarDigitalEcosystemOpenBusinessPlan.</p><p>Dynamics of monoexistential capitalism are generally well understood.
Americanism is rooted in monoexistential capitalism of unbounded-corporations.</p><p>The IPR model of creating artificial scarcity for polyexistentials 
so that monoexistential economic models remain intact is flawed
in the aggregate.</p><p>Possession and ownership of monoexistentials and polyexistentials
are inherently very different. Economic models that have been
established and have worked well in the realm of monoexistentials 
are not equally applicable to polyexistentials.
Basics of monoexistentials and polyexistentials are fundamentally
different and monoexistential capitalism and polyexistential
capitalism need to be fundamentally different. Unlike
monoexistentials that are inherently competition oriented,
polyexistential are inherently collaboration oriented.</p><p>A competing economic model that is in harmony with polyexistence can
easily overtake the IPR economic model. Eastern nations subscribing to
polyexistential capitalism can do a number to Western IPR based
economies.</p><p>Economic ramifications of recognition of fraudulence of western
IPR regime are immense. It is not in the interest of many not to
understand the simple logic of polyexistence leading to
invalidity of IPR. It is very likley that those who are not
understanding this clear logic, are choosing not to understand
because it is not in their interest to understand. Very often
people do not decide with their brain. They decide with their
character. For Americanists their economic interests shapes their
character. Forced extension of economic models of
monoexistential into the realm of polyexistentials is unnatural
and illogical. It is a construct of Americanism.
The Amercianists opposition to our logic is rooted in their interests.</p><p>The Western IPR based capitalist model has pushed for proprietary
activity in the for profit quadrant and non-proprietary activity in
the not-for profit quadrant. This too is artificial. Polyexistential
capitalism is about cultivation of the non-proprietary and for-profit
quadrant. We will expand on this.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec216" Types Of Capitalism-->
<h2 id="sec216" class="section">14.1  Types Of Capitalism</h2><!--SEC END --><p>
<a id="sec:TypesOfCapitalism"></a>
</p><p>As noted, in the Western models, there is no distinction
between monoexistential capitalism and polyexistential
capitalism. Furthermore, there are many views and models for
proper limitations on corporations and place of corporations
through out the western world. With American Capitalism being an
extreme case.
As a result, “Capitalism” has
become a tricky word. It means many things and often not the same
things.</p><p>For our purposes, we use the following distinctions and terminology.</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">American Capitalism:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>
The type of capitalism that extends the
the economic models of monoexistentials to polyexistentials
through IPR, and which only pays lip service to proper bounding
of corporations and which fuses corporation and government
towards corpocracy and which considers foreign and domestic
surveillance as non-negative byproducts of the economic model.
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Monoexistential Capitalism:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>
The type of capitalism
that limits the scope of its economic model to monoexistentials
and monoexistential-dominant mixed-existentials.
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">IPR Oriented Polyexistential Capitalism:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>
The type of capitalism
that distinguishes between monoexistentials and polyexistentials
but which considers the IPR regime as valid.
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Libre-Halaal Oriented Polyexistential Capitalism:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>
The type of
capitalism that builds on Monoexistential Capitalism but governs
polyexistentials and polyexistential-dominant mixed-existentials
based on economic models which do not vioaltes Libre-Halaalness
of polyexistentials.
</dd></dl><p>Notice that the concepts and vocabulary that we have built
earlier in this document, allows us to be precise in
analyzing evolution of capitalism as an economic model.</p><p>The basic premise of traditional capitalism is that people are
economic creatures and through self-interest, the invisible hand
brings order through competition. The metaphor of invisible hand,
introduced by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher and economist
Adam Smith, characterizes the mechanisms through which beneficial
social and economic outcomes may arise from the accumulated
self-interested actions of individuals, none of whom intends to
bring about such outcomes. Adam Smith lived in a world which was
an environment of monoexistentials and monoexistential dominated
mix-existentials. His theory may have had some validity at that
time and in that environment. Things have changed greatly. In the
21st-century we live in an environment where polyexistentials and
polyexistential dominated mix-existentials are supreme. It is
silly to even imagine that the invisible hand is still
applicable. The idea that we can revert back to the 18th-century
environment through IPR is equally silly.</p><p>Capitalism further suggest that value creation should be
primarily economically based through private-sector activity with
minimal public-sector interference. Polyexistentials also render
these concepts obsolete.</p><p>Before digging any deeper, outside of capitalism, let’s consider
“value creation” in some detail.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec217" Types Of Value Creation Machineries-->
<h2 id="sec217" class="section">14.2  Types Of Value Creation Machineries</h2><!--SEC END --><p>
<a id="sec:TypesOfValueCreationMachineries"></a>
</p><p>In the following sections, we will be speaking of “economic
value” and “true value”. In the broader context, for us, value
is a measure of utility. Economic value is determination of the
prices of goods and services. True value is economic value plus
the accounting of all externalities.</p><p>Now let’s consider machineries that create value:
</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Individuals (non-economic):</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>
Let’s say that this book is of some utility. That it has some
value. Let’s further say that we do not want to economically
profit from this book. Then as individuals, we have created value.
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Non-profit Organizations:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>
Groups of individuals, with some declaration of non-profit intent, as an organization can create value.
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Private Sector For-Profit Organizations:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>
Groups of individuals, with some declaration of profit intent, as an organization can create value.
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Public Sector:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>
On behalf of a society, governments can create value. Roads and bridges, for example.
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Global Sector:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> <br>
Collectively, a number of governments can create value. International standards (3GPP) for mobile phones for example.
</dd></dl><p>Now let’s apply the distinction of monoexistentials and
polyexistentals to these types of value creation machineries. And
then on top of that, consider ramifications of having IPR as the
model of governance of polyexistentals vs ramifications of having
Libre-Halaal as the model of governance of polyexistentals.</p><p>Clearly, the economic models that we end up with could be very
different.</p><p>Let’s start by re-visiting American Capitalism from this
perspective.</p>

and American Polyexistential Capitalism. In the 20 century, up
until say the Dot-Con <sup><a id="text19" href="#note19">1</a></sup> era American Capitalism was primarily
monoexistential-dominant mixed-existentials centric. Post Dot-Con
era, American Capitalism became primarily polyexsitentials and
polyexistential-dominant mixed-existentials centric. It is the
model of the second phase, “American Polyexistential
Capitalism” that is particularly ugly and which endangers
humanity.</p><p>This recent enhanced ugliness of evolution of “American
Capitalism” has been observed by many. Various American
academics have focussed on various symptoms, each coming up with
a catch phrase. Tim Wu’s is “The Curse Of Bigness” [<a href="#XX"></a>],
Ramesh Srinivasan’s is “Beyond The Valley” [<a href="#XX"></a>], Rana
Foroohar’s is “Don’t be evil” [<a href="#XX"></a>], Roger McNamee’s is
“Zucked” [<a href="#XX"></a>], Shoshana Zuboff’s is “Surveillance
Capitalism”, Amy Klobuchar’s is “Antitrust”, Zephyr Teachout’s
is “Break’Em Up” and McKenzie Wark’s is “Capital Is Dead. Is
This Something Worse?”</p><p>All of these Americans have recognized that something is wrong.
They all have come up with some type of diagnoses and some
suggested remedy. But none of them permits him or herself to
identify the American IPR regime as the root cause of the
ugliness and none of these thinkers calls for abolishment of IPR.
Copying of all of the above books by all of these authors are
restricted through the US Copyright system. In our view they are
accomplices to what causes the ugliness of American Capitalism.</p><p>Similar to the situation with guns in the United States, there is
general consensus that something is very wrong. But, so what?
Indeed, something far worse than the usual American Capitalism is
at work. Solutions and cures exist only outside of Americanism.</p>

</p><p>Below we reproduce a varbatim copy of an article titled: “Worse
Than Capitalism” by McKenzie Wark which appeared in “Ours To
Hack And To Own” [<a href="#XX"></a>]. In 2016, that article was subjected
to Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
license. Afterwards, we map what she is saying into the model and
vocabulary that we have developed in this document. And we
compare and contrast our views and positions.</p><blockquote class="quote"><p>What if this was no longer capitalism, but something worse? Such a
perspective might help explain some of the features of the contemporary
political-economic landscape. My argument, odd though it may
sound, is that both capital and labor have lost ground to an emerging
ruling class, one that confronts a quite different kind of antagonist.</p><p>It helps to see capitalism as already a kind of second-order mode
of commodified production. First-order commodification
emerged in part, at least — through the transformation of the relations between
peasants and their lords; the peasants lost traditional rights to arable
land and to the commons. In place of the (supposedly) ancient rights
and duties that held between landlord and peasant, in which the
peasant’s duties to the lord were paid directly with a share of the produce,
the peasant had to pay rent in cash.</p><p>First-order commodification was thus the commodification of
land. Pieces of land became abstract pieces of property that could be
bought and sold. Peasants lost traditional rights to land and saw much
of it enclosed and privatized. A “surplus population” of peasants ended
up in the cities, where they were to become the working class, sellers
of labor-power.</p><p>Capitalism was a second-order mode of commodified production,
built on top of the pastoral one that preceded it in the countryside.
One can forget that when David Ricardo wrote On the Principles of
Political Economy and Taxation, he wrote on behalf of a rising, urban,
capitalist ruling class and against the interests of a pre-existing, rural,
pastoralist ruling class. It was a study in intra-ruling class studies.</p><p>In opposition to the pastoralist ruling class, the capitalist ruling
class constructed a rather more abstract mode of production, one in
which not only land but labor and the factory could be elaborate forms
of fungible private property. With the destruction of the privileges
awarded it by the state, the landlord class became a subordinate ruling
class within capitalism, still extracting its extortionate ground rents (as
indeed it still does today) but unable to claim the whole of the state as
its own and to govern exclusively in its own interests.</p><p>The peasantry were, of course, no mere spectators upon their own
oppression, but resisted the landlord class, every so often rising up
against it. However, the peasantry tended toward a politics based on
ancient rights. The rise of the modern labor movement was a cultural
revolution that replaced the backward-looking peasant politics with
a forward-looking one, based on the evident fact of capitalism as the
dominant mode of production.</p><p>Such might be a more or less orthodox thumbnail sketch of the
rise of capitalism in Britain, where it first arose. Of course, elsewhere
in the world it followed different paths. But rather than turn toward
the complicated business of pluralizing this historical sketch, I want
to do something different: to pose the question of whether there is,
on top of the second-order commodified mode of production of capitalism,
a third-order commodified mode of production—what I will
call vectoralism.</p><p>First-order commodification, what I call pastoralism, made land
into a form of abstract private property relation. Second-order commodification,
generally called capitalism, much advanced the abstraction
of the private property relation into fungible things. Third-order
commodication, which I call vectoralism, extends abstraction
much further, subordinating information to whole new kinds of private
property rights, and in the process creating new kinds of class
relations.</p><p>On top of the class relation of landlords and peasants, and of capitalists
and the working class, there is a relation between a vectoralist
class that owns the vector of information in one form or another, and a
hacker class that has to produce new forms of information that can be
made into private property.</p><p>This emerging class relation does not replace previous layers of
commodified abstraction, but it does transform them. Initially, the
vectoralist class enabled capital to outwit the working class in the class
conflicts of the late twentieth century. The information vector was
what enabled capital to route around the power of labor to interrupt
production. The information vector enabled capital to draw resources
from a variety of sources at short notice. The information vector enabled
capital to develop productive resources remote from traditional
working class communities, with their historic memory and capacity
for self-organization.</p><p>In the short term, the vectoralist class was helpful to capital in its
struggle against labor, but in the long run, it is trying to subordinate
capital to itself. Take a look at the top Fortune 500 companies, or the
top “unicorn” venture capital darlings of the moment. With a few
exceptions, one finds iterations of the same thing: companies whose
power and wealth relies on stocks or flows of information, which control
either the extensive vector over space or the intensive vector of an
archive of commodified information—so-called intellectual property.</p><p>Whether it is finance, tech, cars, drugs, food, or chemicals—often
the big companies no longer actually make their products. That can
be contracted out to a competing mass of capitalist suppliers. What the
vectoralist firm owns and controls is brands, patents, copyrights, and
trademarks, or it controls the networks, clouds, and infrastructures,
along which such information might move.</p><p>The rise of the so-called sharing economy is really just a logical
extension of this contracting out of actual material services and
labor by firms that control unequal flows of information. This control
via the information vector is becoming more granular, working
now at the level of individual laborers rather than subcontracted firms.
At first, the vectoral made capitalist firms subordinate. Now, where
they can, the vectoralist class replaces them altogether with individual
subcontractors.</p><p>Like all previous extensions of the abstraction of private property,
this one too produces its own internal antagonist. And like all previous
antagonists, it never appears in a pure and self-conscious form.
Most peasants tugged the forelock and did what they were told, silently
cursing the lord under their breath. Most workers settled for some job
security and a weekend. Radical class-based movements are rare.</p><p>So it comes as no surprise that the hacker class is not particularly
conscious or organized or antagonistic either. But its frustrations
are real. The hacker class designs the information tools by which all
human effort is controlled and organized by asymmetrical flows of
information. The hacker can see her or his own job succumbing to this
tendency in the end as well.</p><p>The organization of the activity of hackers is built into the form of
code itself. Their efforts are compartmentalized and separated —
black-boxed. They work on alienated tasks just as workers do. Only they do not
work from clock-on to knock-off time. Even when they sleep they work
for the boss. They might in some cases be well paid, but in many instances
they are not. Their skills date quickly, and they are replaced by others.</p><p>Hackers won’t necessarily respond to the vectoralist class in traditional
labor movement terms. A strike would hardly be effective given
that hackers can’t shut down production. The most frequent forms of
antagonism are more likely changing jobs, or stealing time on the job
for one’s own projects. Of course many dream of start-up glory, but
that dream quickly tarnishes when the hacker gets to see firsthand who
usually cashes out first in such schemes.</p><p>The significance of platform cooperativism is that it is a movement
that can place itself at the nexus of the interests and experiences of both
workers and hackers. Why not use the specific skills hackers have to
create the means of organizing information, but use it to create quite
other ways of organizing labor? Cooperatives have a long history in the
labor movement; indeed, in their origins, they looked back to forms of
peasant self-organization of the commons.</p><p>Why not re-imagine the cooperative on the basis of contemporary
forms of information vector—but without the information
asymmetries that are the basis of vectoralist class power? That seems
like the thread of a political-economic project that both honors past
struggles and also addresses the distinctive form of commodification in
the age of the information vector as a private property relation.</p><p>The vectoral political economy is in many ways worse than the
capitalist one. It gives the ruling class of our time unprecedented
wealth amid growing poverty and despoliation. It enables that ruling
class unprecedented flexibility in routing around strikes, blockages,
or communal strongholds. It has made the whole planet appear as an
infinitely exploitable resource at precisely the moment when it is also
clear that the past products of commodified production are coming
back to haunt us.</p><p>And yet every advance in the abstraction of the form of private
property also opens up new perspectives on what may be held in
common, and how the common might counter-organize. The practical
and conceptual experiments of platform cooperativism are a key
moment in the advance of this counter-organizing agenda.</p></blockquote>

</p><p>Many of the points made in the reproduced previous section are
consistent with what we are saying.</p><p>The phase that we call American Monoexistential Capitalism, Wark
calls “Capitalism as a second-order mode of commodifed
production”. The phase that we call American Polyexistential
Capitalism, Wark calls “vectoralism” — a third-order
commodifed mode of production. Wark identifies (and refers to it
properly) “so-called intellectual property” as part of the
problem. We consider intellectual property as root problem in
American Polyexistential Capitalism. What Wark calls the “hacker
class”, we call the “global software engineering profession”.</p><p>Our objection to the positions of American academics and
activists, the likes of Wark, is that they are not seeing the
full picture. They don’t dig deep enough and don’t go far enough.
Americans have not recognized the full scope and scale of the harm
of their celebrated economic model. That harm is not just to
themselves, but to all of humanity — as polyexistentials are
non-territorial.</p><p>Sure, what we are observing is worse that capitalism. But, It is
not sufficient to just say that. In this book we go way deeper
and much further.</p>

</p><p>Economic models are human creations for the purpose of bettering human condition.</p><p>Economic models impact human behavior, but humans should not live just
for the purpose of bettering the economic model.</p><p>Corporations are created and exists for the sole purpose of
generating profit.
Consider the equivalent of a person whose sole purpose was accumulation of
profit and power. Would you not be calling him/her a Psychopath?
Such an entity should be bounded, otherwise it will destroy humanity.
Based on this understanding, we draw a distinction between
American capitalism of unbounded-corporations which we consider inhuman
and bounded-corporations monoexistential capitalism to which
we subscribe.</p><p>In monoexistential capitalism, the existence of the subject of
profit is in singular. To a certain extent, this functions as a
natural form of bounding and containment of the corporation.
Extending monoexistential capitalism into the realm of
polyexistentials in the proprietary and for-profit quadrant
empowers the unbounded corporation to profit from the unbounded
replicability of polyexistentials.</p><p>Western IPR regime has resulted in transfer of more power and
more control to the unbounded Americanist corporations. The
overwhelming majority of copyright and patents are controlled by
corporations — not individuals.</p><p>Highly optimized economic models can destroy humanity.
Economic models define human behavior. Money becomes everything.
People start living for money. But, economics is full of
externalities and other aspects of life start being damaged.
Before you know it, people become economic creatures.
All of this has already happened in the context of the American
Capitalism<a id="hevea_default105"></a>. Before you know it, the rest of humanity will become
Americanized. Humanity is at risk.</p><p>American Capitalism is not just an economic system. It is a value
system. It is intertwined with extreme individualism (khodzadegi)
and greed.</p><p>The economic model of bounding corporations to the halaal
manner-of-existence of polyexistentials protects humanity in the
context of a profit-oriented highly competitive polyexistential
capitalism. This can be the foundation of an economic system that
results in bettering of human condition and can protect humanity from
corporations.</p>

</p><p>A business or other construct may be characterized as either
proprietary or non-proprietary. And it may be characterized as either
for-profit or non-profit. And generally speaking these
characterizations are orthogonal. Thus there are four quadrants in
which a construct may reside.

the non-proprietary model in existence today.</p><p>The notion of a non-proprietary construct, residing and operating
within the for-profit sector, is new and different. Historically,
the for-profit sector has been closely associated with
proprietary ownership of assets. Hence the Internet Services
industry and the likes of Blackberry as we see them today. Also
historically, management of non-proprietary or public assets has
been primarily associated with the non-profit sector. Hence the
current orientation of the Free Software<a id="hevea_default106"></a>
Movement, operating largely within the non-profit sector.</p><p>We propose a radical shift of the Internet Services industry from the
for-profit, proprietary quadrant, to the for-profit, non-proprietary
quadrant. In this space the entire software for an Internet service

profession, while service deployment is driven forward by the full
force of for-profit commercial motivations.</p><p>This radical shift to the <em>non-proprietary, for-profit
quadrant</em>, causes a major industry reconfiguration, with
significant winners and losers. The losers are the existing
vested proprietary interests, whose economic hegemony
vanishes. But the winners are the many more companies who can now

<!--TOC subsection id="sec228" Transformation of Software into Services-->
<h3 id="sec228" class="subsection">14.5.1  Transformation of Software into Services</h3><!--SEC END --><p>To the above we now add another dimension. That of Software Vs Internet Services.</p><p>Part of the debate about free software is now over, while part
continues. The part that is over is any question about the viability
of free software as a development model for creating large-scale,
complex, relevant software systems. GNU/Linux is a fully viable free
software alternative to the proprietary Microsoft Windows operating
system, against which it continues to make steady inroads. Mozilla is
a fully viable alternative to the proprietary Microsoft Internet
Explorer, and is also experiencing steadily increasing usage. These
and numerous other free software projects—Apache, Qmail, Sendmail,
Bind, Plone, Snort and many others—have now become essential and
widely used components throughout the software and Internet
industries.</p><p>And apart from such well-known and high-profile projects, behind the
scenes the free software movement has become a flourishing creative
environment, generating a constant stream of new and better software
packages, duplicating and surpassing the capabilities of an
ever-increasing portion of proprietary software territory.</p><p>And the fundamental free software creative dynamic has now also become
very well understood: the free software development model allows <em>unrestricted creative reuse of existing assets at essentially zero
cost</em>. It is from this dynamic that the free software model derives
its tremendous generative power. Free software is thus fully
established as a generative engine and an industry reality, and is
here to stay.</p><p>But the part of the debate that continues is whether or not this has
any meaningful commercial dimension. Within the proprietary software
domain a powerful revenue-generating engine exists in the form of the
traditional software licensing model. But this revenue source is
absent under the free software model. In its place there are a number
of possible business and revenue models, but in all cases these lack
the large-scale repeatability that makes things really interesting
from a business perspective.</p><p>There thus remains a conceptual gap, a puzzle, about how the powerful
generative forces of free software can be turned into a large-scale,
repeatable, revenue stream. But this puzzle is now solved. And in this
business plan we present the solution.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec229" Business Dynamics Of Internet Services-->
<h4 id="sec229" class="subsubsection">Business Dynamics Of Internet Services</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Within the Internet
Services industry industry the business and revenue
models are quite clear and obvious. The largest and most obvious are
the subscription fee model of generalized service providers, and the advertising model of numerous specialized no-cost service
providers, demonstrated most spectacularly by Google. Both the
subscription fee and advertising models are unlimitedly scalable, thus
resulting in the gigantic commercial Internet of today.</p><p>But the Internet Services industry of today is a fundamentally
proprietary construct. While proprietary service providers can and do
make frequent use of free software components within their services,
they do not espouse the free software development model itself, and
their technical development process remains competitive and
proprietary. Though they may incorporate free software components, Facebook
and Google are certainly not free software.</p><div class="center">

<a id="fig:summaryFigure"></a>
<div class="center"><hr style="width:80%;height:2"></div></blockquote><p>Thus as we look at the software and Internet industries of today we
see two largely disjoint cultures. As illustrated in Figure
<a href="#fig%3AsummaryFigure">14.2</a> we see the free software domain, with its
powerful generative and propagative development model, but lacking any
clear large-scale monetization model. And separate from this we see
the proprietary Internet Services domain, with enormous revenue and
business consequences, but handicapped in scope and scale by its
competitive development model.</p><p>But now we are witnessing a further transformational event in the
evolution of the Internet: a shift of traditional software
applications towards a service-based implementation, or what is
sometimes called the “transformation of software into services.” And
this is the critical event that now solves the free software revenue
puzzle. This development unites the generative power of the free
software domain with the proven revenue models of the services domain.
The transformation of software into services <em>allows the powerful
generative model of free software to be invested directly into the
powerful revenue model of the Internet Services industry</em>.</p>

</p><p>Capitalism operates on supply and demand as the basis of value.
There, open and unlimited availability translates into zero
market value. In that model non-rivalry goods are worthless. So,
in that traditional economic model, polyexistentals are not
economically sound.</p><p>In the context of Libre-Halaal software (FLOSS) and internet
application services the common revenue generation model has been
that of providing value added services rather than from the
original development of the core open software. Since, as the
core Libre-Halaal software is unrestricted polyexistentials, from
a market value standpoint, that developed software is worthless.</p><p>Yet, Libre-Halaalness of polyexistentials leads to limitless
availability of useful works. This is a profoundly good thing
from the perspective of maximizing value, and thus suppressing it
is deeply misguided.</p><p>Attribution-based economics is a new model that aims to remedy
this state of affairs by changing the basis of value from supply
and demand to collective recognition. This is facilitated by a
process of "inheritance attribution" where we collectively agree
on the extent of inherence of ideas and works in other (e.g.
derivative) ideas and works, by means of transparent and evolving
standards. This model is capable of recognizing a much larger set
of valuable contributions, including forms of value that cannot
be coerced into a supply-and-demand equation. That is, in this
model, there is no need to artificially restrict availability in
order for something to be considered valuable. By virtue of the
curious property that innovations on the process are themselves
subject to the process of recognition in a self-reflective way,
we gain accuracy, and by the property that agreed-upon standards
apply equally to all, we gain fairness – guarantees that are at
best tenuously present in today’s economic systems.</p>

ones, but what if I told you that the solution to this problem and the
solutions to the others are one and the same?</p><p>And it’s because there’s a common underlying problem at the heart of all of
these problems. I’m going to tell you what that problem is in one sentence.
You ready for it? It is ... the deviation of market value from true value.
Let’s think about this in the context of existing economic systems such as
capitalism and communism.</p><p>And of these, I want to focus on capitalism because it is the only nontrivial
economic system, really. Communism is more sort of a political means to
achieve economic ends. And the other economic systems exist sort of on a
spectrum between these two. So let’s focus on capitalism. Capitalism has as
its basis of value supply and demand. And consequently, there is a great
emphasis on this idea of ownership. Now ownership is an idea that made some
kind of sense when you have goods and services that are constrained in some
way, that are essentially finite in supply. But when you have things like
works of software, art, and music, which are essentially infinite in supply,
the idea of ownership and supply and demand don’t make sense anymore. And yet
we employ the institution of property to constrain supply and introduce the
idea of supply just so that we can induce a market value in terms of supply
and demand in a capitalist economic system. And it’s wrongheaded.</p><p>How many of us have written copyright declarations like these on our work.
It’s a lot of work! Especially when we have version control. Now in this
example, almost every line is written by a different person, so who owns the
code in this case? Who owns the copyright here? Is it some of them, is it all
of them, do they share it in some way? It doesn’t really make sense,
especially when the reason we’re employing copyright and ownership in this
case is to approximate the idea of attribution, which is what we really care
about here. And that brings us to the nature of the solution, which is to move
away from an economic system based on ownership and supply and demand, to an
economic system based on attribution, instead. That is, moving away from who
owns what to who did what and how important was it. And we can do this by the
process of Dialectical Inheritance Attribution, which just means that we do it
in a collective way using common collectively agreed upon standards that are
applied transparently to all. And when we have an economic system that is
based on attribution as the source of value in this way, we call it
attribution based economics. Now, once we have that, it gives us fairness,
effective empowerment of expertise, freedom through incentives rather than
through coercion. And privacy as well.</p><p>But I could tell you all of those things and some may still say, "Why should I
care about this?" There are those who would say that fairness is not a good
goal, and that might makes right, and that as Darwin showed us, the nature of
nature is violence. Now I know that many of us reject this ideology, and we
feel in our bones that it is wrong. But luckily we don’t have to resort to
high philosophy and gut feeling in order to convince ourselves that an
attribution-based system is truly better. Because in addition to all of those
other properties we talked about, an attribution-based economic system is also
efficient. And I say this from the perspective of having an admiration for the
efficiency of capitalism. So understand that that is my perspective when I say
that this system — an attribution-based economic system — is significantly
more efficient than capitalism. And it achieves that by virtue of eliminating
the waste that is inherent in adversarial competition, while still preserving
market forces!</p><p>... Now, I don’t know about you, but I’d prefer to avoid fighting these
gyroscopic forces. I’d rather have these forces work with me rather than
against me. Now in a capitalist system, there is another problem, which is
that not only do you have these gyroscopic forces at work, but these forces
aren’t even all working together. They’re working against each other, in many
cases. They represent misaligned interests. And indeed, these misaligned
interests are the very means by which these forces operate at all. So in a
way, war is not just an inevitable consequence in this system but is rather
the very nature of such a system. In an attribution-based system, on the other
hand, by virtue of the source of value being collective attribution, we are
able to achieve alignment of all of these interests at every scale, so that at
every scale of society, from the smallest to the largest scales, the interests
will be aligned, will be consonant and harmonious. I think this is a very
important, profound quality that I think is the fundamental problem of
economics - the fundamental goal of economics to solve. And I believe that an
attribution-based economic system addresses it and solves it.</p><p>... The second component of the implementation is the accounting system. All
accounting is public. All payments into the repo are public and all payments
out of the project are also public. We can do some things for privacy, and
again, the basis of this system is dialogue. ... I</p><p>... You can financially support an ABE project. This is important
to do because the system won’t get started without money as an input. And it
also has network effects, as we saw — the more money you contribute, the more
incentive there is for other people to join the system. And contributions are
also attributable, as we said earlier. Some of them can be treated as
investments. ...</p><p>Now in this world, we are told that we should look out for ourselves because
no one is going to look out for us. That we should take care of our own
because we can’t rely on others to care. An attribution-based economy is
nothing like that. We care about each other, we take care of each other,
because taking care of one another is valuable, and an attribution-based
economic system is capable of recognizing that value, in financial terms. And
as a result, we are safe in the embrace of the world. ...</p></blockquote>

the for-profit and non-proprietary quadrant. For software, the
business models are not as favorable as the for-profit and proprietary

of our business plan is to get traditionalist monoexistential venture
capitalists to understand the economics and business dynamics of
polyexistentials.</p><p>In the context of this concrete example of ByStar open business plan,
we are looking for a venture capitalist who can see that it is to
his/her economic advantage to consider the Western IPR regime as

<h1 id="sec235" class="chapter">Chapter 15  Promulgative Ethical And Religious Cures</h1><!--SEC END --><p>
<a id="chap:PromulgativeEthicalAndReligiousCures"></a>

</p><p>Questions of Ownership are the inherent domain of morality, ethics and religion.</p><p>Earlier we said “IPR is Haraam”, but who are we to make such declarations? Uses and
introductions of halaal and haraam by individuals here and there are of some importance
and significance. But, it is broad consensus and widespread acceptance of halaal and
haraam that results in significant moral impact. Halaal and haraam declaration are more
significant when they reflect consensus of a profession. Halaal and haraam declaration are
far more meaningful when they reflect the consensus of a religion.
Ethical Halaal is far more significant than moral Halaal.</p><p>How are we to arrive at that broad consensus and widespread acceptance? </p><p>In the West, people attempt at expressing their take on right and wrong and all of that
right and wrong becomes quickly irrelevant when economics comes into the picture – as
economics is the center of the Western model. So, for the most part, halaal and
haraam are academic and anecdotal in the West.</p><p>To the extent that religions can be considered vehicles for promotion of morality and
ethics, based on their track record; a religion can be considered weaker or stronger
compared to another religion.</p><p>Church and State were easily separated in the West as Christianity
is a weak religion.
Christianity draws a clear separation between the two worlds and the two times. 
The Western Christian model has become very “Secular” now.
The
definition of the purely Western word and the concept of “Secular” by Webster is:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Of or pertaining to this present world, or to things not
spiritual or holy; relating to temporal as distinguished
from eternal interests; not immediately or primarily
respecting the soul, but the body; worldly.
</blockquote><p>In that simple Western Christian model, the Church is in control of the other world
(heaven and hell) and the State is in control of this world. And the State quickly boils
down to economics and the Corporation.</p><p>The concepts of halaal and haraam are totally absent in Christianity. Christianity does
not concern itself much with this world.</p><p>Westerners consider their idea of separation of church and state as prescriptive.
They believe that their notion of church applies to all religions and 
that their concept of religion emanating from Christianity is universal.
The concept of separation of religion and state is in no way universal. </p><p>Unlike Christianity, Islam is a strong religion which concerns itself fully with both
worlds. The founding fathers of the Islamic Republic were quite familiar with the West’s
history of the Dark Ages. Those who wrote the Islamic Republic’s constitution had read the
French and the American constitution and were familiar with the lessons of the French and
the American revolution. The founding fathers of the Islamic Republic 
fully understood the Western concepts of separation of church and state
and they fully rejected these concepts.</p><p>The model of fusing Islam and the Republic is complex and powerful. It is only such a
model that can preserve humanity and it is only this model that can stand against the
Western model of economic creatures calling their collection a society.</p><p>Halaal and haraam are of this world. Halaal and haraam are for this world. Only a
religion that fully concerns itself with both worlds can properly drive forward, Halaals
and Haraams. <a id="hevea_default108"></a>Secular Western and Christian models of focusing on each of the two worlds
separately, at best will result into highly diluted Halaals and Haraams.</p><p>In the Muslim model, declarations of halaal and haraam by sources of imitation play an
important role in moving society forward as new topics for Halaal and Haraam arise.</p><p>For example, towards societal consensus on halaal manner-of-existence of software,
consider Imam Khomeini<a id="hevea_default109"></a>’s fatwa on invalidity of Western Intellectual Property Rights regime
which has paved the way towards current sources of imitation digesting the software
engineering profession’s definition of halaal manner-of-existence of software.</p><p>Consensus amongst Muslim sources of imitation in recognizing halaal
manner-of-existence of software and halaal manner-of-existence of internet services can
result in significant moral impact towards preventing the harm that the current disastrous Western
model of manner-of-existence of software and internet services are headed for.</p><p>Majority of Grand Ayatollah’s are against so-called IPR Regime.</p><p>We humbly offer our professional analysis to Ghom<a id="hevea_default110"></a> and Najaf<a id="hevea_default111"></a> towards
establishing a full consensus against the Western so-called IPR Regime.</p><p>Explicit and repeated fatwas against the Western so-called IPR Regime
will assist the cure.</p><p>We humbly offer our professional analysis to Vatican and Protestants
towards establishing a full consensus against the Western so-called
IPR Regime.</p><p>Explicit and repeated decrees against the Western so-called IPR Regime
will assist the cure.</p>

economic creatures in Las Vegas need not even know what halaal means.</p><p>But things have changed, and that separation is no longer viable. Knowledge and
application of knowledge are now more than ever essential to health of any society and the
digital era is here. Polyexistentials are now a dominant reality. Unlike a world
dominated by monoexistentials, a world dominated by polyexistentials demands greater

Imam Khomeini (peace be upon him) in Tahrir ol-vasileh on the subject of Western Intellectual Property has written:

right to restrict another with regard to his full ruler-ship on
his own property.</p><p>And also that which has become famous as “Monopoly Of Commerce Over An Object Or Objects” (trademark)

“that which has become famous”. These emphasize that
copyright, patent and trademark are non-Iranian and non-Islamic
concepts which he fully rejects.
</li><li class="li-itemize">The essence of Imam Khomeini’s rejection of copyright, patent and trademark
is the dilutive impact on ownership of real property.

America’s Founding Fathers were businessmen. It is this
difference in perspectives (philosphy vs economics) that has lead to

detrimental to civilization and humanity. We must create an alternative digital

particular process is typically followed. This process involves
the creation of three sets of documents. We will follow this same
engineering process, by applying it to the entirety of our

<!--TOC subsection id="sec249" Definition Of Libre-Halaal Internet Application Services-->
<h3 id="sec249" class="subsection">16.2.3  Definition Of Libre-Halaal Internet Application Services</h3><!--SEC END --><p>First, we need to define what we mean by internet services.</p><p>Internet application services allow for remote execution of software and remote delivery
of the results of that execution. So, to begin with, for the internet application service
to be considered Libre-Halaal, the remote software that is executed must be Libre-Halaal.</p><p>Our scope here is internet application services at layer 7, not services related to
internet connectivity at layer 3. For brevity, some times we refer to internet application
services as internet services.</p><p>As mentioned in Section <a href="#sec%3AHalaalManner-Of-ExistenceofInternetServices">5.6.3</a>, internet
services are Libre-Halaal Internet Services if they have all of the following attributes:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">

guardianship responsibilities is verfication of claims by internet service providers
against what the service actually does (based on analysis of source code of the software).
Another guardianship responsibility is to produce more and better internet services in a
collaborative environment. Another intent of this definition is to maximize accrued
benefits from the internet services to society. These goals are in harmony with nature of
software as polyexistentials.</p><p>Use of internet services impact autonomy of the individual in ways that use of software
does not. With software you are not restricted with the choices that the service provider
has made on your behalf. Use of software is more convivial than use of internet services.</p><p>Use of internet services impact privacy of the individual in ways that use of
software does not. When you run and control the software of your own email server, your
emails are in your own exclusive possesion. When you use Gmail, your emails are also on
Google’s possession. When you run a software on your own computer, the logs of what you
requested and how the software accomplished your instructions are in your exclusive
possession and logs of your activities are private. When you use an internet application
service logs of what you requested and how the software/service accomplished your
instructions are in possession of the service provider. The service provider has the
ability to monitor your activities. You may then have less privacy. Furthermore, when you
use internet application services and interact with other individuals or organizations
logs and perhaps content and details of your interactions are also in possession of the
service provider. As a result, the individuals with whom you corresponded may then have
less privacy as well. When you use internet services, both you and those that you have
been interacting with are potential subjects of surveillance at layer 7.</p><p>Surveillance capitalism drives the American proprietary digital ecosystem and loss of
privacy and autonomy of the individual are considered natural by products of technolgy in
Americanism.</p><p>In Libre-Halaal digital ecosystems, things are different. We protect against loss of
privacy and autonomy by providing proper defenitions for Libre-Halaal Internet Services.</p><p>Therefore, definition of Libre-Halaal Internet Services also involve protection of privacy
and autonomy of the individuals. To provide for such protections, we need to go beyond the
halaal manner-of-existence of internet services and regulate internet application service
providers.</p><p>Based on capabilities and services that internet services provide, we can identify
different type of internet services. These include:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Possession Assertable Libre-Halaal Services — Abstract real individuals. Email,
Messaging, Autonomous Web Publication
</li><li class="li-itemize">Content Syndication Libre-Halaal Services — YouTube like services
</li><li class="li-itemize">Information Provider Libre-Halaal Services — Google Map and Google Search like services
</li><li class="li-itemize">Group Collaboration Libre-Halaal Services — Github, Zoom like services
</li><li class="li-itemize">Mediated Inter-Autonomus Communication Facilitation Libre-Halaal Services — Craig’s List, dating, eBay like services

</li><li class="li-itemize">Brokerage Oriented Libre-Halaal Services — booking.com like services
</li><li class="li-itemize">Escrow Oriented Libre-Halaal Services — escrew.com like services
</li></ul><p>In Libre-Halaal digital ecosystems, Each of these types of internet application services
demands its own specific set of regulations.</p><p>Surveillance capitalism driven American proprietary internet application services are
inherently central. The service provider sits in the middle, observes and controls
everything on large scale and exploits individuals on the periphery.</p><p>The type of regulations that are needed are very different for each type of Libre-Halaal
Services. At this time we focus on just two types that are being implemented in ByStar.
Future updates to this document will include more details with respect to regulations of
each type.</p><p>Possession Assertable Libre-Halaal Services (PALS) are the main building block of
Libre-Halaal digital ecosystems, through which internet services are forced to be
de-centralized.</p>

proprietary commercial interests. Google, Yahoo <a id="hevea_default126"></a>, MSN, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook, Apple,
and virtually every other Internet service—these are all proprietary for-profit
corporations, with no obligation towards the public welfare.</p><p>This represents a grave hazard to the broader interests of society. 
The existing proprietary digital ecosystem
is well on its way towards the destruction
of humanity. Under immediate threat of destruction are the privacy of
the individual, and the autonomy of the individual. </p><p>Loss of autonomy and privacy are symptoms of the basic model of the
Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem. At societal level, autonomy and privacy
can not be preserved just with new technology. There are no band-aid
technical solutions.</p><p>The basic model of the Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem is all wrong.</p><p>There is already
the beginning of dawning realization within society of the growing

The world is not sliding, but galloping into a new transnational dystopia. This
development has not been properly recognized outside of national security circles. It
has been hidden by secrecy, complexity and scale. The Internet, our greatest tool of
emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of
totalitarianism we have ever seen. The Internet is a threat to human civilization.

Zuckerberg <a id="hevea_default127"></a> has done more harm to the human race than anyone else﻿ his age.
</blockquote><p>Moglen (2011) also says:</p><blockquote class="quote">

</blockquote><p>Scott McNealy is quoted (1999) as saying:</p><blockquote class="quote">
You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it.

We need to re-decentralise the Web.
</blockquote><p>Tim Berners-Lee <a id="hevea_default128"></a> (2014) is even willing to think of responsibilities of the “geek
community as a whole” — but as a Westerner, he is apparently unable to recognize
Software Engineering as a global profession with global responsibilities. So, he says:</p><blockquote class="quote">
It’s important to have the geek community as a whole think about its responsibility and
what it can do.
</blockquote><p>Donald Knuth says:</p><blockquote class="quote">
A mathematical formula should never be “owned” by anybody! Mathematics belong to God.
</blockquote><p>Steve Jobs has said something along the lines of:</p><blockquote class="quote">
If you’re not paying for something, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold.
</blockquote><p>Even the British Sir Elton John, who has made his fortunes from copyright restrictions,
now kind of gets it. When it comes to pharmaceutical companies profiting
from the miseries of the sick through patent restrictions, Elton John says:</p><blockquote class="quote">
We must end the greed of these corporations.
</blockquote><p>Edward Snowden (2013) says:</p><blockquote class="quote">
“if a surveillance program produces information of value, it legitimizes it. . . . In one
step, we’ve managed to justify the operation of the Panopticon.”
</blockquote><p>The Panopticon is a architectural concept for a prison where the guards can watch, unseen
by the inmates, from a tower in the middle into all cells build in a circle around the
tower. It leaves the inmates in a perceived state of permanent surveillance. The French
philosopher Michel Foucault described the effect:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Hence the major effect of the Panopticon: to induce in the inmate a state of conscious and
permanent visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power. So to arrange things
that the surveillance is permanent in its effects, even if it is discontinuous in its
action; that the perfection of power should tend to render its actual exercise
unnecessary; that this architectural apparatus should be a machine for creating and
sustaining a power relation independent of the person who exercises it; in short, that the
inmates should be caught up in a power situation of which they are themselves the bearers.
</blockquote><p>The original Panopticon, like the digital versions the likes of NSA and Microsoft are
building, takes away all feeling of privacy. Even when one is not watched, knowing that
the possibility of being watched is always there, creates uncertainty and leads to self
disciplining and self censorship. It is certainly a state the powers that be would like
everyone, except themselves, to be in.</p><p>To call these signs of deterioration of humanity is an understatement.</p>

<h3 id="sec253" class="subsection">16.3.2  Denial, Ambivalence, Ignorance, Inevitability and Acceptance</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Many think that there is no problem. </p><p>Many Americans work for the likes of Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, etc. Or they are
related and dependent on these companies. If bread and butter of these companies was to
become profiting from crushing autonomy and privacy of the individual, most of their
employees would likely not have any interest in facing an honest mirror. That has already
happened.</p><p>People are naturally good at justifying the morality of their
self-interest in a variety of forms. Mass psychology then kicks in and
reinforces short term interests towards global mass exploitation.
It is an inherent characteristic of citizens of unchecked powers to confuse
morality with self-interest. Consider America and Americans.</p><p>From the perspective of a drug dealer, use of drugs is no problem. Many drug pushers are
drug users. They want every body to be using drugs. After all, it is a profitable
business and economics is the basis of everything. When someone tells them that subjecting
cocaine to business and economics is wrong, the drug dealer does not
have the ear for it.</p><p>Individual’s autonomy and privacy are not market commodities. They are part of humanity.
The problem that we are pointing to is a human problem. This could well not be a problem for
economic creatures existing in an exploitative industrial context — that is how pure raw
American capitalism is viewed by many.</p><p>This sort of thing happens gradually. People become accustomed to the problem. They become
dependent on the problem. They become the problem. The next generation is born into it.
And then there is no problem.</p><p>Everybody does it. Everybody is on Facebook. What problem?</p><p>The public at large, and the young in particular, follows and is manipulated. They sit in
awe of Internet technology. Ignorant, they trust the specialists who are there to milk
their soul. The latest gadget and the latest Internet feature includes exploitation of
another aspect of their privacy. They feel in charge while being used. And they feel
empowered. </p><p>The concept that these very same awesome capabilities and technology can exist in
a healthy context is foreign to the public at large. Industrial tools is all that they
have seen, Tools for Conviviality, [<a href="#PLPC-120037"></a>], is Greek to them.</p><p>Others kind of see the problem but consider it inevitable. More recently, discussions of
loss of privacy in the context of Internet services has become a daily occurrence in
mainstream western press. None of these discussions has any depth and no meaningful cure
is even searched for. Many articles and books have been written about “End of Privacy.”
Shallow, subdued nagging — that is the position and role of American press on the problem.</p>

</p><p>The broad label that we use for Internet services and software as it
exists and is practiced today, is: “The Proprietary American Digital
Ecosystem”. We include the term American in this label not just
because it is dominated by America, but because it is rooted in
American values and American rules. The American purely economic
model and widespread practices which are based on Western IPR regime
has led to dominance of Internet by large American corporation and
governance of the Internet through Corpocracy. These corrupt values
and models are now being exported and forced on the rest of the world
in the name of Internet.</p><p>The manner by which the Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem is shaped by American
societal norms is multi-faceted. To better understand this, in Figure
<a href="#fig%3AproprietaryDeLayers">16.2</a> we provide a layered model.</p><div class="center">

basis of the layered model that we present as a moral alternative in Section <a href="#TheLibre-HalaalByStarDigitalEcosystem">17.2</a>. Note that without recognizing and tackling the underlying
root causes of the problems that the proprietary American digital ecosystem present, it is
not possible to cure these problems. When the underlying nature of any public digital
ecosystem is proprietary, it poses a danger to health of society.</p><p>In the following sections, we focus on specific aspects of the above layered model.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec257" Competing Proprietary Digital Enclaves-->
<h3 id="sec257" class="subsection">16.5.1  Competing Proprietary Digital Enclaves</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem comprises of a number of competing Proprietary
Digital Enclaves. The proprietary Microsoft digital enclave is one such example. The
Microsoft enclave has had its roots in the proprietary software business and is now trying
to bring in proprietary services. The proprietary Google digital enclave is an other
example. The Google enclave has had its roots in the proprietary search business and is
now trying to integrate with more software and services. Apple, Facebook and Amazon are
examples of other American Digital Enclaves. What they all have in common is that they are
all competing locked environment driven by Patent and Copyright laws. None of these
enclaves were designed ab-initio to be digital environments for humanity. All of these
enclaves exist primarily to generate profit for their owners.</p><p>This model of being governed by competing proprietary enclaves is normal and even desired
by most Americans. The American medical system is similarly structured and so is the
American food system.
From the outside, many view Americans
as purely economic creatures that exist in an industrial context who are fully committed
to supremacy of money. While the proprietary American digital ecosystem my be fine for
Americans, it may not be for the rest of the world. Bits are without border and this
American disease 
has been spreading.</p><p>Ramifications of manner-of-existence of the proprietary digital
ecosystem, matters in two important ways. It matters in terms of
service functionality—what the service itself is actually doing. And
it matters in terms of policy—what the service provider is doing.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec258" Ramifications On Service Functionality-->
<h3 id="sec258" class="subsection">16.5.2  Ramifications On Service Functionality</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Regarding service functionality: existing proprietary services such as
Google, Yahoo, YouTube, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and virtually
every other service—these are strictly controlled assets of their
owning companies, heavily defended by patents and copyright. The software
that runs the service is closed, such that the true service
functionality is unknown. This means that the user of the
service you have no knowledge of what the service is actually doing
behind the scenes. For example, you have no knowledge of what the
service is doing with your personal information. Every item of
information you provide to the service, either implicitly or
explicitly—every communication, every search query, every website
visited, every mouse click—can be used by the service provider for
unknown purposes, without your knowledge or consent.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec259" Ramifications On Service Policy-->
<h3 id="sec259" class="subsection">16.5.3  Ramifications On Service Policy</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Regarding policy: in principle, the service provider’s actions are constrained by the
Service Agreement (Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, etc.) between the provider and
user. However, these agreements are drafted by the provider’s corporate lawyers, consist
of sophisticated legalese that few users read, and are heavily biased towards the
interests of the provider. In particular, they are drafted without any formal
representation or advocacy for the interests of the user.</p><p>Proprietary services are operated by corporations whose actions are driven purely by
profit. This is the single ultimate purpose of the proprietary service provider, to which
all other considerations come secondary. In particular, both functionality and policy are
dictated wholly by this purpose, with no concession towards the interests of the
individual user or the general public welfare, beyond what contributes directly or
indirectly to profit.</p><p>This closed, profit-motivated and -dominated Internet services model represents severe
endangerment to critical civil liberties such as privacy, freedom of information, and
freedom of speech.</p><p>The existing proprietary regime leads to the wrong manner-of-existence for software and the
wrong model for provision of Internet services. Wrong in that it allows control of the
service by the provider, and exploitation of the user’s data, in a way that is detrimental
and unknown to the user. The solution to this is an entirely different model for Internet
services, where service ownership is placed squarely in the public domain.</p>

</p><p>Dear Fellow World Citizen,</p><p>In the Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem (Internet Application
Services as they exist today), the individual’s autonomy and privacy
are being crushed. A deal has been made. Users free-of-charge
get: email, calendar, address book, content publication, and Facebook
friends. In return, American corporations get: semantic analysis of
email, spying with consent, traffic, logs and trail analysis and
behavior cross referencing. </p><p>A new currency has been created. The user’s autonomy and
privacy is now the implicit Internet currency. 
For now, the established business model is
that of translation of the individual’s privacy into targeted
advertising. That business model will naturally grow in scope.
The debit side of this new currency is civilization and humanity. </p><p>Today, the world is largely unaware of this. The public is completely
oblivious to the perils of the proprietary Internet model, and happily
entrusts its personal data, its privacy, its freedoms and its civil
liberties to proprietary business interests. And the people whose
responsibility it is to safeguard the public interest – government,
and the engineering profession – are asleep at the wheel. Or worse yet,
they have become accomplices.</p><p>In addition, Internet services are inconsistent, disparate and incoherent.
Resulting into 10s of passwords for the individual on services over
which she has no real control. The dynamics and trends of the
Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem are such that autonomy and
privacy of the individual will continue to deteriorate.</p><p>This is about rescuing humanity from the dragnet of Google, Facebook and America’s
surveillance economy. <span style="font-weight:bold">Our primary offerings are real, tangible and practical
autonomy and privacy – on very large scale.</span></p><p>We are Internet Engineers. We know that we can design and create a
complete parallel digital ecosystem which preserves the individual’s
autonomy and privacy – to compete with and stand against
the existing Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem. And
we have done so.</p><p>But to put it in its intended widespread usage, we also need your participation (our
fellow engineers, journalists, financiers, academics, government representatives,
ethicists and users). Preservation of autonomy and privacy are multi-dimensional. So, we
have taken it upon ourselves to also consider philosophical, moral, societal, social,
economic and business dimensions of our parallel digital ecosystem.</p><p>The umbrella title that we have chosen for our work is:</p><blockquote class="quote">
<span style="font-weight:bold">The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem</span><br>

</blockquote><p>ByStar (By* – pronounced by-star) is based on the model of Federations of Autonomous
Libre-Halaal Services and is being presented as a moral alternative to the American
Proprietary Digital Ecosystem.</p><p>The totality of Libre-Halaal software, Libre-Halaal Internet services,
content generation and publication facilities and societal
frameworks that we describe are designed for preservation of ByStar
user’s autonomy, privacy and freedom. 
The health of society is our objective.
This is not about rejection or prohibition or censorship of Internet. This is about
creation of a parallel digital ecosystem within the Internet based on values which are 
very different from the economically driven proprietary American digital ecosystem.</p><p>By “Digital Ecosystem”, we mean the whole thing, including
inter-related software, systems, services, content and
societal frameworks. The integrated facilities of ByStar are intended
to be used by a very large segment of population on this planet. The
scope of these integrated offerings is vast – paralleling most of
what exists in the proprietary Internet today.</p><p>The parallels include:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
A functional equivalent of Gmail that recognizes your mailbox must be autonomous and private.
</li><li class="li-itemize">A functional equivalent of Facebook that is based on facilitation of end-to-end private interactions.
</li><li class="li-itemize">A functional equivalent of YouTube that recognizes your content as yours.
</li><li class="li-itemize">A functional equivalent of Windows that creates a deep Software-Service continuum.
</li></ul><p>In the ByStar model these capabilities are
unified, consistent and coherent.</p><p>This is not about any new particular functionality.
It is not a faster, cheaper, better story.
In terms of functionality, what we offer is generally same as what exists today. Our
model provides for the existing functionalities, while offering tangible autonomy and
tangible privacy.</p><p>The ByStar model empowers the user herself, to be her own
Application Service Provider (ASP). This model of “Be Your Own
ASP”, is based on comprehensive Libre-Halaal software and a
cohesive infrastructure that any user can choose to fully host her own
cloud services (Do It Yourself ByStar), or use pre-made
autonomous cloud services (We Do It For You ByStar).</p><p>There is nothing anti-business about our offerings and our moral stands. The ByStar
business model is simply different from the current dominant American business models of
exploiting privacy and autonomy. We are in the business of providing autonomy and privacy.
And there is plenty of money in that.
Broad and deep usage of our software and our Internet application services will create
revenue opportunities that are similar to those of large Internet application service
providers today. These revenues include subscriber fees, advertising, customization
consultation, general consultation and interaction facilitation fees. Profit, business
and economics are an integral part of ByStar.</p><p>Key distinguishing aspects of our approach and software and services
are:
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Preservation of the individual’s autonomy. ByStar services are inherently
autonomous. They belong to each and every one of their owner-users – not the service
provider.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Preservation of the individual’s privacy.
The individual is in full control of her service.
She can fully control her privacy.
</li><li class="li-itemize">They are comprehensive, unified, consistent and cohesive.
The scope of ByStar is everything. The “*” in By* comes from the
glob expansion symbol. And all these services are unified with the
ByStarEntity model.
</li><li class="li-itemize">They are rooted in the correct manner-of-existence of software and services. The
entirety of ByStar software and services are internally transparent. ByStar software
and services development process is fully collaborative. Based on the nature of
polyexistentials, ByStar ideology fully rejects the Western Intellectual Proprietary
Rights regime.
</li></ul><p>In other words,
morality, health of society, and well being of
humanity are an integral part of 
software and services that we offer.
This work is primarily not Businessman driven. It is
Engineer driven.
</p><p>We believe that privacy, autonomy and freedom aspects of the Digital Ecosystem that we are
creating are important enough to “convert” many existing proprietary service users to
become Libre-Halaal ByStar users. All attempts at claiming autonomy and privacy in the
proprietary model are hollow at most. It is not possible to offer real and tangible
autonomy and privacy without committing to complete internal transparency of software and
services. The proprietary model leads to dark software and dark services (internally
opaque) which are inherently anti-autonomy and anti-privacy.</p><p>Such a large undertaking by such a small group should normally amount
to not much more than pipe dreams. Typical first reaction to our
claim is a chuckle. Some say it is insane. Many say that the notion
of creating a parallel digital ecosystem is so very lofty that
it can’t be realistic. </p><p>There are several reasons why we believe widespread usage of what we
are building is more than plausible. It is viable and likely. </p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
ByStar ideology is in harmony with nature.
We understand the enormous, seismic force that accompanies 
<a href="http://www.halaalsoftware.org">halaal manner-of-existence of software</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.libreservices.org">halaal manner-of-existence of Internet services</a>

Manifestations of this force include
the Free Software Movement and GNU/Linux. But there is far more to come.</li><li class="li-enumerate">We have already built the needed framework and starting points. 
These are in place and are growing.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">The ByStar model grand design is broad, evolutionary, expandable
and it can grow to scale to planet wide usage.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">The demand for autonomy and privacy are very real.
Many are starting to recognize that things
like Facebook are very wrong. Healthy alternatives are craved. </li><li class="li-enumerate">The business and economic models for ByStar have been thought
through and are being cultivated.
</li></ol><p>There are two fundamental concepts at the core of what we are presenting and offering:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Humans are more than just economic creatures. Internet’s model can not be based on pure economics.</li><li class="li-enumerate">The Western Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime is
a colossal mistake – Western IPR laws are in conflict with nature and detrimental to civilization.</li></ol><p>If you are unable or unwilling to explore the truth behind these basic
concepts, 
then ByStar is likely not for you. 
</p><p>If you recognize the critical distinction between humans and economic creatures,
and if you recognize the basic human need for autonomy and privacy, 
and if you are willing to explore the rejection of the Western IPR regime, then the

<!--TOC subsection id="sec263" Root Causes Of The Problem-->
<h3 id="sec263" class="subsection">17.1.1  Root Causes Of The Problem</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The Internet has its origins in America. In the beginning, the Internet was a healthy
Engineering construct – and we played a minor role in its formation. The initial model of
the Internet was rooted in the end-to-end model of interactions between autonomous
entities/individuals, but things changed quickly. The Internet became a business
construct. Now, the current basic model of Internet is rooted in the rise-of-the-middle
model of corporations exploiting the individual.</p><p>Today’s Internet has been shaped by Proprietary American values.
And this is the root cause of the problem.</p><p>

<a id="TheLibre-HalaalByStarDigitalEcosystem"></a></p><p>The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem model is fundamentally
different in every respect.</p><p>In terms of ownership, there is no ownership: Libre-Halaal Services in software form are a
communal public resource, with no patent, copyright or secrecy barriers to free access and
usage by anyone.</p><p>In terms of functionality, the software is open, so the services are completely
transparent in operation. This transparency allows professional oversight by the
engineering community, to verify the integrity of the service, ensuring that it in no way
violates the interests of the user or the general public welfare.</p><p>And in terms of policy, operation of the service is governed by a social contract, drafted
with full representation and advocacy for the individual user and the general public
welfare.</p><p>The Libre model thus fully guarantees the critical civil liberties that are endangered
under the proprietary model.</p><p>By* Federation of Autonomous Libre Services are Internet
Application Services that are internally transparent and focus on
preservation of user’s privacy and autonomy. By* stands against
Facebook/Google/Yahoo/MSN/iCloud the same way that Linux stands against
Microsoft Windows.</p><p>This is very different from existing Internet services capabilities. The Internet landscape
of today has arisen in a highly disorganized, unstructured way, driven by a multitude of
uncoordinated commercial ventures. The existing services capabilities have been built in a
completely ad hoc manner, based on immediate business expedience, rather than any sort of
coherent design. The result is the Internet Services industry as it appears today: a
multiplicity of functionally isolated, incompatible services. And while this may not be
apparent to the everyday user, having never experienced anything different, this limits
the capabilities of Internet services in many ways.</p><p>By* is the model for a new generation of unified Internet services, far superior to the
uncoordinated mishmash of services that exists today. It is designed for consistent,
uniform interoperability across all types and manners of service usage. By* is the
Internet services industry, done right.</p><p>We now present an overview of our work and the contours of ByStar
in 4 regards – Ideology, Model, Capabilities and Economics.</p>

digital ecosystems are laws and models governing polyexistentials (knowledge, ideas,
information, the digital entities). Societal Agreements governing all that is digital (and
more broadly polyexistential) in the West is based on the IP regime. This has shaped the
entirety of Western Digital Ecosystems.</p><p>In contrast, ByStar is ab-initio driven by the ideology that morality and health of
society should be the foundation of the ByStar digital ecosystem. The fundamental
difference between ByStar ideology and the Proprietary American ideology is that in ByStar
priorities, society/humanity comes first and profit/economics come second.
In the Proprietary American priorities profit/economics comes first and above all else.</p><p>
In Figure <a href="#fig%3AbxIdeologyDocs">17.1</a>, we present a roadmap in forms of
layers. Each layer has a document that addresses that concept. Each layer
builds on the layers below. At the lowest layer lies moral and
societal questions of right and wrong (halaal and haraam).
</p><p>The two green layers at the bottom are philosophical, moral and societal. Their scope is wider
than the moral digital ecosystem that we are after. Generally speaking, they are not the
domain of engineers. They are the domain of ethicists, philosophers and sociologists.</p><p>The blue layers are philosophical, moral, societal, social and engineering aspects of
digital ecosystems that require direct involvement of engineers.</p><p>180016</p>

<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec267" The ByStar Reference Model-->
<h4 id="sec267" class="subsubsection">The ByStar Reference Model</h4><!--SEC END --><p>ByStar is based on a set of key abstractions, representing the major
real-world entities that must be represented within a generalized web
structure. These entities include such things as individual persons,
businesses, physical locations, and events. For each such entity we
have defined the structures and conventions required to represent,
instantiate and name that entity in a unified, consistent way, and at a
very large scale. We have then defined the major classes of services
required to manage these entities, and to allow highly generalized
interactions within and among each other.</p><p>In the ByStar applied model, a real-world entity type (for example
individuals or a physical locations) maps on to
a <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarEntityType</span> (<span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntityType</span>). 
A real-world entity instance maps on to a <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarEntity</span> (<span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntity</span>)
All ByStar services are anchored in <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarEntity</span>.</p><p>ByStarEntityTypes are structured hierarchically in a tree.</p><p><span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarEntityType</span> is either a <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarAutonomousEntityType</span>
or a <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarControlledEntityType</span>. </p><p><span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarAutonomousEntityType</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarControlledEntityType</span> are either
Classified or UnClassified.</p><p>In this structure, persons identified by their name, are represented as:</p><pre class="verbatim">  ByStarEntityType=ByStarAutonomousEntityType.Classified.Person.ByName
</pre><p>Each <span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntity</span> (an instance) is identified by <span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntityId</span>.</p><p>A <span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntityId</span> is structured as:</p><pre class="verbatim">  BxEntityId=RegistrarId+BxEntityType+InstanceId
</pre><p>All ByStarEntityIds are unique. The <span style="font-family:monospace">InstanceId</span> is assigned by the <span style="font-family:monospace">RegistrarId</span>.</p><p>Each <span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntity</span> can be activated within a
<span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine</span> (<span style="font-family:monospace">BxAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine</span>). <br>
The representation of a
<span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntity</span> in a <span style="font-family:monospace">BxAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine</span><br>
is called a
<span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarServiceObject</span> (<span style="font-family:monospace">BxServiceObject</span>). <br>
A <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarServiceObject</span> maps to a Unix account and
a user-id.<br>
The <span style="font-family:monospace">BxServiceObject</span> can have any
<span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarServiceCapability</span><br>
that <span style="font-family:monospace">BxAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine</span> offers.</p><p>Currently, ByStarServiceCapability is one of the capabilities enumerated in figure <a href="#fig%3AbxEntityCapabilities">17.3</a>.</p><p>Any <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarServiceCapability</span> can be bound to and exposed through a
registered domain name.</p><p>Based on the above structures, ByStar services can consistently grow
and interact with other ByStar services to provide a rich and healthy environment.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec268" Domain Name Bindings Of ByStarEntity-->
<h4 id="sec268" class="subsubsection">Domain Name Bindings Of ByStarEntity</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Each <span style="font-family:monospace">ByStarEntity</span> consists of specific information and a set of computing and
communication services.</p><p>Publicly, <span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntity</span> is usually exposed throughout Internet at a 
selected DNS domain name. In the ByStar model, binding of a <span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntity</span> to
one or more domain names is designed to be very flexible. This flexibility relates to
Service Portability, but is broader. These notions are absent or very rare in the
Proprietary American model.</p><p>For instance, in the context of the examples described in Section
<a href="#ByStarEntityRealizationExamples">??</a>, Bob Smith is assigned BxEntityId=23.1.2.7.3.32674
which is canonically bound to the base domain name <span style="font-family:monospace">5.bob.smith.byname.net</span>.</p><p>ByStar permits Bob Smith to bind his BxEntity to other domain names, for example
bobsmith.fr. In the ByStar BySMB service this is common place. Often, with the
anticipation of obtaining example.com, example.bysmb.com and its BxEntity can be
pre-generated. The owner, can re-adjust the binding of BxEntity to a chosen domain name 
at will.</p><p>Different information, different capabilities and different features of a
<span style="font-family:monospace">BxEntity</span> are usually bound to different domain names within a base
domain name hierarchy.</p><p>For example, Bob’s imap service is at <span style="font-family:monospace">imap.5.bob.smith.byname.net</span>, his genealogy
service is at <span style="font-family:monospace">geneweb.5.bob.smith.byname.net</span> and his synchronization repository
(version control – vc) is at <span style="font-family:monospace">vc.5.bob.smith.byname.net</span>.</p><p>In cases where the owner asserts autonomy by possession of the service as a
<span style="font-family:monospace">BxAutonomyAssertionVirtualMachine</span>, ByStar provides the ability to selectively DNS
resolve BxEntity domains locally. This, then also permits fully local (non-networked)
development and access to BxEntity – based on existing DNS bindings.</p><p>These flexible ByStar domain name to BxEntity bindings, and flexible DNS resolutions, are
built on top of djbdns.</p>

<div class="center"><hr style="width:80%;height:2"></div></blockquote><p>Internet services come in all shapes and sizes, serve all manner of purposes, and interact
with each other and with societal entities in all manner of complex ways.</p><p>In some cases a service may be associated exclusively with a particular societal entity,
such as an individual, an organization, or a corporation. Such entities enjoy a high
degree of autonomy within society, and so we refer to these as autonomous entities. When a
service is associated uniquely with particular autonomous entity, we refer to the entity
as the owner of the service.</p><p>When a service is associated with a unique “owner”, certain characteristics of the service
are of particular concern to the owner. The service may include information of a personal
or private nature, and the owner may wish to ensure that his/her/its privacy is
protected. It is also important that the service reflect and maintain the autonomy of the
owner, providing parallel freedom of action to that which the owning entity enjoys at
large.</p><p>Certainly, the privacy and autonomy of the owner are fully guaranteed if the owner
exercises direct control over the functioning and provision of the service. In practice,
an owner may or may not choose to exercise such direct control of the service. In many
cases the owner of the service will leave the service provisioning in the hands of a
second-party service provider. Nevertheless it is sufficient to guarantee the autonomy of
the owner if the nature of the service is such that the owner could in principle take
control of the service himself.</p><p>We define an <span style="font-weight:bold">autonomous libre-halaal service</span> as an Internet service associated with a
unique owner, that the owner could in principle and at his option take control over and
provide for himself.</p><p>ByStar services are structured in two layers.
(1) ByStar Autonomous Services and (2) ByStar Federated Services.</p><p>Any ByStar Autonomous Service may also include ByStar Controlled Services.</p><p>As noted, in many or most cases the service will be provided by a second-party service
provider, who runs and administers the service on behalf of the owner. The autonomy of the
owner requires that he is in no way tied to this or any other service provider. The
general societal autonomy of the owner means that for any other type of service—banking,
legal, medical—the owner is free to move from one provider to another, leaving no trace
of himself behind with the previous provider.</p><p>In the case of Internet services, similar principles apply. For a service to be an
autonomous halaal service, it must satisfy the twin requirements of <span style="font-weight:bold">portability</span>,
and <span style="font-weight:bold">non-retention</span>. Portability, meaning the owner can transport the entire service
to a different service provider. And non-retention, meaning the previous provider must
retain no trace of the owner’s information.</p><p>Specifically, when a second-party provider is providing the service on behalf of the
owner, the service is an autonomous halaal service if the provider meets the following
requirements:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Service and Data Portability</span>. At the instruction of the service owner, the
entire service can be transferred to a different service provider. This could be another
second-party provider, or the service owner himself.
</li><li class="li-enumerate"><span style="font-weight:bold">Service and Data Non-Retention</span>. At the instruction of the service owner,
the service provider must destroy all service-related information (i.e. all owner data
and log files).
</li></ol>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec270" ByStar Controlled Services – Internet Of Things-->
<h4 id="sec270" class="subsubsection">ByStar Controlled Services – Internet Of Things</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Any ByStar Autonomous Service may control certain “ByStar Controlled Services” 
that are his.</p><p>A ByStar Controlled Service is a ByStarEntity which is in control of
ByStarAutonomousEntity.</p><p>As an example consider an individual (say the author –
<a href="http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net</span></a>) who hypothetically owns 
a house, a bicycle, a Nike fuel band and a tag for his suitcase.</p><p>Virtual representation of these could be:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
A House – <a href="http://info.1-98008-5807-10.bywhere.net"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://info.1-98008-5807-10.bywhere.net</span></a> – where ByWhere structure
links control to its owner (a ByStarAutonomousEntity).
</li><li class="li-enumerate">A Bicycle – whose location information goes to it owner (a
ByStarAutonomousEntity) and not Google-corporation.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">A Nike Fuel Band – which send the exercise information to its owner-individual
(not Nike-corporation).
</li><li class="li-enumerate">A tag for his suitcase – which links to it owner (a ByStarAutonomousEntity).
</li></ol><p>Each of these as a ByStarControlledEntity will be controlled by the
ByStarAutonomousEntity. All of these are 
ByStarEntity-s. The ones that are controlled, link to their controller.
The ByStarAutonomousEntity has links to all the
ByStarControlledEntity-s that it controls.</p><p>So, we now have a framework for abstracting individuals as
owners/controllers through ByStarAutonomousEntity. And we have
abstractions for things to be owned and controlled through
ByStarControlledEntity. And we have a framework for interaction
of individuals/things and things/individuals through ByStar Federated
Services.</p><p>Now, compare the model of ownership and interactions of Things in
Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem – which is anchored in the
autonomous individual – with the Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem
– which is anchored in the Proprietary Corporation. There the
proprietary internet service provider controls individuals also through
Things.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec271" ByStar Federated Services-->
<h4 id="sec271" class="subsubsection">ByStar Federated Services</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Autonomous services and their controlled services may wish to engage in end-to-end
interactions with other autonomous services. But in order to facilitate such interactions,
involvement of some intermediary services may be needed.</p><p>We refer to such enabling intermediary services as <span style="font-weight:bold">federated
services</span>, and we refer to the association of a federated service
plus its subscribing autonomous services as a <span style="font-weight:bold">federation of
autonomous services</span>.</p><p>The concept of Federated Services is layered above Autonomous Services and
focuses on interactions amongst Autonomous Services and facilitation of information
aggregation amongst ByStar Services.</p><p>An example of a federated service for information aggregation is
ByTopic.org where autonomously published content
(documents/music/video) is optionally centrally republished –
autonomous and federated publication are fully consistent.</p>

<a id="sec:ToolsForConviviality"></a>
</p><p>Our primary criteria for software component selection and service design is
“conviviality”.</p><p>By conviviality we refer to the concept of 
“Tools for Conviviality” as Ivan Illich
introduced it. </p><p>In the document titled:
</p><blockquote class="quote">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Introducing Convivial Into Globish</span><br>
 <a href="http://www.by-star.net/PLPC/120044">http://www.by-star.net/PLPC/120044</a>
</blockquote><p>
we introduce the concept of "Convivial" into Globish.</p><p>Briefly, in Illich’s words:</p><blockquote class="quote">
Tools are intrinsic to social relationships. An individual relates
himself in action to his society through the use of tools that he
actively masters, or by which he is passively acted upon.<p>To the degree that he masters his tools, he can invest the world
with his meaning; to the degree that he is mastered by his tools,
the shape of the tool determines his own self-image. Convivial
tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest
opportunity to enrich the environment with the fruits of his or
her vision. Industrial tools deny this possibility to those who
use them and they allow their designers to determine the meaning
and expectations of others. Most tools today cannot be used in a
convivial fashion.
</p></blockquote><p>The dynamics of the Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem are such
that they produce industrial tools.</p><p>The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem is designed to fully reside in the 
Libre-Halaal-Convivial quadrant, [<a href="#PLPC-180044"></a>]. </p>

information in the Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem is the
centrally controlled <a id="hevea_default131"></a>Rise-of-the-Middle model – which puts the service
provider at the center of all interactions so that it can exploit users
and traffic information. </p><p>The ByStar model, in contrast, is end-to-end oriented and is based on the
following principles:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Make Services Autonomous Whenever Possible (peer-to-peer oriented)
</li><li class="li-itemize">Invest and Focus on End-to-End communications facilities amongst
Autonomous Libre Services
</li><li class="li-itemize">When a Federated Service functions as an intermediary, limit its role to the bare
essential of hooking the two ends. Thereafter, communications can be end-to-end.

<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec277" Choice Of Software Components-->
<h4 id="sec277" class="subsubsection">Choice Of Software Components</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The Libre-Halaal software model is a flourishing creative environment,
generating a constant stream of new and better software packages,
duplicating and surpassing the capabilities of an ever-increasing
portion of proprietary software territory. Indeed for any particular
item of functionality, there are typically multiple alternative free
software packages available.</p><p>In this environment the model for implementation of By* service
functionality is not one of original software development. Rather it
is a process of intelligent selection and integration of functional
components from the Libre-Halaal software creative environment.</p><p>So in creating By* our task has not been to write functional software
components—in fact we have written almost none. Our main task has
been to make careful engineering choices among the available free
software components, and integrate these properly into the By*
framework. In making these choices we consider not just the features
and capabilities of each software component, but also the
compatibility of the component within the overall By* architecture.</p><p>The main considerations in our choice of software components have been:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Conviviality</li><li class="li-itemize">Scalability</li><li class="li-itemize">Libre-Halaal Mainstreamness</li><li class="li-itemize">ByStar Consistency</li></ul><p>Virtually all the initial By* service functionality has been created
this way. The following are some of the basic By* features that have
been included by this process:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Debian GNU/Linux.</li><li class="li-itemize">Base: djbdns, daemontools, ucspi, multilog, ... </li><li class="li-itemize">Mail: qmail, courier, spamassassin, ezmlm, ... </li><li class="li-itemize">Web: apache, zope, plone, geneweb, squirellmail, jquerymobile, galleria, ... </li></ul><p>We will continue to select and incorporate additional software
packages as these materialize within the free software environment. We
will not create, so much as we will harvest. Or to paraphrase the
common industry dictum: <em>Good programmers write good software; great
programmers reuse and integrate</em>.</p><p>This is the extraordinary power, and magic, of free software: the
ability to take things and reuse them at extremely low cost. This is
what has allowed a small consulting company in Bellevue to create the
beginnings of something that can eventually displace MSN and Google.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec278" Confidentiality, Anonymity and Privacy-->
<h4 id="sec278" class="subsubsection">Confidentiality, Anonymity and Privacy</h4><!--SEC END --><p>By confidentiality we mean: ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.</p><p>By anonymity we mean: the characteristic of any interaction where an individual protects
his or her identity from being shared with another person or with a third party in the
context of particular communications.</p><p>By privacy we mean: the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves and thereby reveal themselves selectively. </p><p>ByStar Autonomous Services are designed to provide tangible confidentiality, anonymity and
privacy on large scale. All of Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem has this inherent design.</p><p>The basic assumption in the ByStar Digital Ecosystem is that all communications and
traffic is subject to eavesdropping and traffic analysis. </p><p>Fortunately, the nature of digital information is such that it is easier to encrypt 
than it is to decrypt.</p><p>With nature on our side, ByStar Digital Ecosystem provides large scale countermeasures
which include end-to-end data confidentiality and traffic flow confidentiality.</p><p>ByStar federated services are governed by transparency and well understood logging
expectations and audit trail protections which are oriented towards preservation of
privacy.</p><p>All of this is in stark contrast to how confidentiality, anonymity and privacy are in the
American Proprietary Digital Ecosystem. There, they have become a currency.</p>

fully automated creation of new service instantiations—are 
in place for a number of ByStarEntityTypes.
Current ByStarEntity Generators are shown in Figure <a href="#fig%3ALS-Assets">17.5</a>

We thus have the ability to create unlimited
numbers of new accounts in batch mode, or at any time we can

individual and business users.</p>

relations. 
Current Federated Services are shown in Figure
<a href="#fig%3ALS-Assets">17.5</a> under the “ByStar Federated” label.</p><p>Our initial focus amongst federated service are those used for
information aggregation. These include ByTopic, ByContent and BySearch.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec291" Growth of user base: timing-->
<h4 id="sec291" class="subsubsection">Growth of user base: timing</h4><!--SEC END --><p>An important consideration is the point at which we will begin to accept
the burden of significant numbers of users. </p><p>In the case of a conventional service deployment there is typically a
major emphasis placed on early and rapid growth of user base, to
demonstrate demand and marketplace viability of the service, and lay
claim to a particular portion of functional territory. This was modus
operandi during the dot con era, where claims of user base numbers
were an integral part of spin-and-flip and pump-and-dump model. Some
of those attitudes still persist.</p><p>However we are not following this standard early proof-of-service
approach. This may be appropriate for a conventional new service,
where service functionality is the central and most critical issue.
But for ByStar, a different timing strategy is
required.</p><p>First, as a superset of numerous existing services, proof of service
for By* in functional terms is already demonstrated by the Internet
Services industry as it exists today. It is far more important to
prove the model itself rather than its functional manifestations, and
hasty creation of user base does little to accomplish this.</p><p>Instead we have provided a coherent and complete description of the
model in this and our other documents. The theoretical basis for the
model is solid, and this will be clear to anyone willing to invest the
time to understand it. In addition a number of working By*
implementations are already in place; examples are provided.
Though the scale of usage remains small,
these are sufficient to demonstrate the viability of the Libre-Halaal model
and the ByStar design, and the value of the resulting services to paying
clients.</p><p>But a far more important consideration is that installed base is very
costly in terms of maintenance and support, and premature exposure to
these costs can jeopardize the more critical work of building the
underlying model machinery. Therefore we will not take on the burden
of user base until the time and/or context is right for this. This
means either that we are fully ready to accept the associated costs of
ownership, or that the user base is being taken on in an appropriate
context, such as a suitable business partnership.</p><p>Under either scenario our strategy is the same: at the right time we
will populate the services at large scale by mass creation of By*
service accounts for large existing user bases, [<a href="#PLPC-110005"></a>].</p><div class="center">

<h4 id="sec294" class="subsubsection">Relationship With FOSS / FLOSS / FreedomBox Movements</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Free and open-source software (F/OSS, FOSS) or free/libre/open-source
software (FLOSS) is software that is both free and open source. It is
liberally licensed to grant users the right to use, copy, study,
change, and improve its design through the availability of its source
code. In the context of free and open-source software, free refers to
the freedom to copy and re-use the software, rather than to the price
of the software.</p><p>Libre-Halaal ByStar Ideology and FOSS Ideology have a
great deal in common and we closely collaborate with our FOSS brothers
and sisters, but the ByStar Libre-Halaal Ideology is distinct.</p><p>We invite our “Free Software” and “Open-Source” brothers and sisters
to recognize that the “Libre-Halaal Software” model is a more complete model
and that the “Libre-Halaal Software” label is a better label.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec295" Active Private Parallel Digital Ecosystems – Example: NSA-->
<h4 id="sec295" class="subsubsection">Active Private Parallel Digital Ecosystems – Example: NSA</h4><!--SEC END --><p>What we want to do on very large scale and in the open has been done 
in medium scale in private. </p><p>For instance, the United State’s National Security Agency (NSA) has
created a separate parallel private digital ecosystem for its own use.
NSA operates the private .nsa TLD; many NSA internal email addresses are of
the form username@r21.r.nsa, mirroring the NSA organizational group
structure. NSA has a particular ideology for its digital ecosystem
which includes a large element of security, confidentiality and
secrecy. NSA through use of its own particular software and services
has created a complete different environment in parallel to the
internet.</p><p>Precedence of such private parallel digital ecosystems combined with
the proven power of Libre-Halaal software demonstrates that widespread
realization of ByStar digital ecosystem is very viable.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec296" Relationship With Piecemeal Privacy and Autonomy Software And Services-->
<h4 id="sec296" class="subsubsection">Relationship With Piecemeal Privacy and Autonomy Software And Services</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Some engineers kind of get it and have been trying to build various piecemeal privacy and
autonomy software and services. Such efforts have always stayed limited in scope and
scale. That is primarily for two reasons. First, because the engineers have failed to connect with
society. And second, because piecemeal solutions don’t work. </p><p>We build on these piecemeal privacy and autonomy software and services and bring them into
ByStar as integrated and complete large scale services.</p><p>An example of a piecemeal privacy effort is PGP - Pretty Good Privacy. A bunch of engineers and
technologists use it amongst themselves but PGP never penetrated the society at large.
ByStar comes with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as an integral part of the service and
equivalent of PGP is an inherent part of ByStar.</p><p>Another example of a piecemeal privacy effort is Tor <a href="https://www.torproject.org"><span style="font-family:monospace">https://www.torproject.org</span></a>.
Tor attempts to accomplish traffic flow confidentiality just through redirection. Traffic
flow confidentiality is an inherent part of ByStar which includes redirection and layer 3
and layer 7 padding as well.</p>

philosophical, moral, societal and engineering terms, we now turn our
attention to the economic and business dimensions. </p><p>We are devout monoexistential capitalists. </p><p>The existing capitalist model for
monoexistentials is generally correct, in both philosophical and
economic terms. But the extension of the monoexistential capitalist
model into the domain of polyexistentials, based on the Western IPR
regime, is a grave mistake. Philosophically it is wrong. Societally it is harmful to
humanity. And economically it is unstable and vulnerable, since it can
be displaced by disruptive business models like ours. The ByStar Open
Business Plan explains how this will come about, and
how we will profit from this.</p><p>We expand on this in Chapter

<h4 id="sec298" class="subsubsection">Revenue model for Libre-Halaal Software</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The Libre-Haraam software model, operating under Western copyright restrictions, includes a
highly effective recurring revenue generation model: the proprietary software licensing
model.</p><p>But the Halaal manner of existence of software eliminates all restrictions on the
distribution and use of software. Thus the Proprietary-Haraam recurring revenue model is
also largely eliminated. Recurring revenues under the Libre-Halaal software model are much
less than under the Haraam software model.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec299" Revenue model for Libre-Halaal Internet Services-->
<h4 id="sec299" class="subsubsection">Revenue model for Libre-Halaal Internet Services</h4><!--SEC END --><p>The Halaal manner of existence of software creates a powerful generative development model
for Libre-Halaal Internet Services. This generative model is absent from Proprietary-Haraam Internet
Services. Thus Libre-Halaal Internet Services have a major advantage and can compete directly
with Proprietary-Haraam Internet Services in terms of development.</p><p>The basic recurring revenue models for Libre-Halaal Internet Service providers are
essentially the same as for Proprietary-Haraam Internet Service providers. Thus in terms
of revenue generation, Libre-Halaal and Proprietary-Haraam services are on an equal footing.</p>

various processes, and sell finished services to our customers.</p><p>In Figure <a href="#fig%3AbystarSupplyChain">17.7</a>, we illustrate the ByStar value

notice that “Neda Operated By* Services” establish a direct
relationship with Subscribers and Users at the very top. Note that
the scope of these Internet services is everything – the * in By* –
and that the intended scale of these services is planet-wide. 
By definition, no Internet services opportunity can be bigger than that.</p><p>The arrows between Neda Services and User/Subscriber in Figure
<a href="#fig%3AbystarSupplyChain">17.7</a> include an element of “Trust, Loyalty, and
Respect” which is the result of “ByStar Ideology” that we presented
earlier. The element of trust and respect is fully absent in the left
column. In business terms, Trust and Respect, translate into
“stickiness” – where the user is more committed to the service.
So, you see, all our investments in ideology are actually also business
wise.</p><p>All of the ByStar value chain software is Libre-Halaal (Free and Open
Source) software. ByStar software in Figure
<a href="#fig%3AbystarSupplyChain">17.7</a> is shown in two different colors. </p><p>The software in bright blue represents Debian and/or Ubuntu GNU/Linux
and the specific software packages that we have chosen. These are
externally developed open source software packages which are typically
subject to the free software GPL license (or similar) which permits
their inclusion in proprietary services. This is often referred to as
ASP loophole.</p><p>The software in bright green is the software that Neda has developed. It is subject to
the “Affero General Public License Version 3” (AGPL3) and Neda Commercial License (Dual
Licensed). AGPL3 closes the ASP loophole. Any ASP which uses ByStar software must
subject its changes and improvements to AGPL3 and make its changes and improvements
publicly available. Those ASPs not wishing to do so, can use ByStar software through the
Neda Commercial License.</p><p>In the left column of Figure <a href="#fig%3AbystarSupplyChain">17.7</a>, we
illustrate a typical proprietary ASP who is incorporating ByStar as
part of its services based on the Neda Commercial License.</p><p>In this environment the model for implementation of By* service
functionality is not one of original software development. Rather it
is a matter of selection and integration of already available software
packages. Virtually all existing By* service functionality has been
created this way—in building By* we have written almost no new
software components at all.</p><p>Thus we are not so much in the business of software development, as we
are in the business of software integration. But the integration of
software components to produce a coherent service is far from trivial.
We have created a sophisticated technical integration environment for
this purpose, called the <span style="font-weight:bold">Neda Libre Services Integration
Platform</span> (Neda-LSIP) [<a href="#PLPC-110501"></a>].</p><p>Design of LSIP and the <span style="font-weight:bold">ByStarEntity Software Platform</span> recognize the
evolution of underlying external software (bright blue) in the ByStar value chain.bywhere
This is the extraordinary magic of Libre-Halaal
software and services: the ability to take things and reuse them at extremely low
cost. This is the fundamental growth dynamic of Libre Services, and
the powerful generative force that is lacking in the proprietary
model. This is the key dynamic that causes the By* Libre Services
eventually to surpass the proprietary model entirely in terms of
features and functionality.</p>

description of how these documents collectively draw a comprehensive picture.</p><p>The big ByStar picture is shown in Figure

<a href="#fig%3AbystarEcosystemRoadmap">17.8</a>. 


Each of the layers in this figure
represents either a conceptual definition (shown in blue), or an
actual software/service implementation (shown in orange). Each layer
builds on the layers beneath.</p><p>The layers in Figure <a href="#fig%3AbystarEcosystemLayers">17.9</a> are color coded.
Each of the layers are either:</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">A Conceptual Layer.</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> Representing concepts. Layers 1,2,3,4,7 and 8 are in Green, Blue and Yellow.

</dd></dl><p>The tangible layers are bound by the conceptual layers underneath them and receive
legitimacy from those concepts.</p><p>The conceptual layers are validated by the tangible layers.</p><p>The green layers (1 and 2) at the bottom are philosophical, moral and societal. Their
scope is wider than the moral digital ecosystem that we are after. Generally speaking,
these are not the domain of engineers. They are the domain of ethicists, philosophers and
sociologists.</p><p>The blue layers (3, 4 and 8) are philosophical, moral, societal, social and engineering aspects of
digital ecosystems that require direct involvement of engineers and the engineering
profession.
The yellow layer (7) addresses economics and business dimensions of ByStar.</p><p>The orange/brown layers (5 and 6) are engineering constructs. 
They are in-use software and in-use Internet application services.</p><p>In ByStar Roadmap:

societal, engineering, economic and business dimensions of the ByStar
Halaal Digital Ecosystem are layered as described above.</p><p>Note the differing characterizations of this layering on the left and
right. Both characterizations are valid, but they reflect entirely
different viewpoints. The left side characterization is called “The
Human Model,” and reflects the philosophical, moral and societal
elements of the model. It also identifies the role of the engineering
profession in maintaining these elements. The right side
characterization is called “The Venture Capitalist Model,” and is
very different from the “The Human Model.” The same elements are
present, but now represent their significance as part of an investment
strategy. Thus the moral and societal concerns within the human model
are now viewed as a sales and marketing opportunity. This makes clear
that when dealing with Venture Capitalists, issues of morality and
societal welfare are not the topic of discussion. In this regard
Venture Capitalists need only understand that human beings are in fact
concerned with vital moral considerations such as “privacy” and
“autonomy,” and that these considerations have powerful sales and
marketing consequences. And that our unconventional strategy of
overturning their sacred-cow – Copyright and Patent model – gives us a
huge competitive advantage.</p><div class="center">

<h2 id="sec303" class="section">17.3  Dynamics of the Libre-Halaal vs. Proprietary-Haraam Battle</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Though it is not part of popular cultural awareness, there is
currently a titanic battle taking place between two competing
ideologies: the proprietary software model (exemplified by Windows),
and <a href="http://www.halaalsoftware.org">the libre-halaal software
model</a> (exemplified by GNU/Linux). This is a to-the-death battle,
from which there can eventually emerge only a single winner.</p><p>The software battle is part of a broader ideological contest, about
ownership models for
<a href="http://www.by-star.net/PLPC/120033">polyexistentials in
general</a> (software, but also including literature, music, images,
movies, etc.) in the digital era. This ideological war is rooted in
the manner-of-existence of digital entities as this has broader
ramifications for individuals and society – which impact autonomy,
privacy, freedom, and social interaction.</p><p>The inherent nature of software, Internet services and other polyexistentials is
fundamentally at odds with these historical conventions of physical property
(monoexistentials) ownership. Such constructs have the inherent potential for unlimited
replicability and dissemination, and in the age of the Internet this potential is now
fully realized.</p><p>As a result the existing western Intellectual Property conventions are coming under
increasing stress, as the internal forces of replicability clash with the externally
constraining Intellectual Property framework. The Intellectual Property regime is also
coming under formal intellectual attack, as the dysfunctionality and true costs of this
regime become increasingly apparent.</p><p>In practice, the proprietary software and services model has engaged
in various forms of bastardization of libre-halaal software
model. Well recognized examples of such bastardizations include the
service loophole, Tivoization, Appleization, and Androidization. </p><p>In practice, open-source and free software movements represent compromising
models and ideologies. For the most part they are comfortable being intertwined with
the proprietary model. Full rejection of the proprietary model is
considered radical in much of the open-source culture.</p><p>In practice, with ByStar ideology we accomplish three things. First,
we create a completely separate and independent digital ecosystem that
fully rejects the proprietary model. Second, we take all possible
measures to prevent bastardization of ByStar software and services by
the proprietary model. Third, we create a comprehensive internet
services business model which competes directly with the proprietary
model in terms of revenue and profit.</p>

<h3 id="sec305" class="subsection">17.3.2  War Of Ideas – War Of Words</h3><!--SEC END --><p>ByStar is huge and powerful and viable. But given the entrenched vested
interests in opposition to it, the promotion of ByStar amounts to a kind of
war. ByStar has the inherent characteristics to prevail in this war – we have
moral superiority, intellectual correctness, and a construct that is viable in
every respect: technological, economic, societal etc. But it is essential that
all this be communicated effectively.</p><p>The ByStar Wars (to coin a phrase) will be fought on multiple fronts. But as a
revolutionary movement, to a significant extent it will be fought as a war of words and
ideas. This means that the movement is advanced effectively in words, defended against
attack in words, and extremely forceful and effective counter-attack made against its
detractors.</p><p>Please refer to <a href="http://www.by-star.net/bxPublications"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.by-star.net/bxPublications</span></a> for a list of publications

<h3 id="sec306" class="subsection">17.3.3  Tear Points Of Libre-Halaal and The Proprietary-Haraam Tussle</h3><!--SEC END --><p>We have analyzed the forces in nature that
work against the existing Proprietary American Digital Ecosystem – and those
which are in harmony with the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem –
and have identified a number of “tear points”. Our execution is
focused on these tear points.</p><p>For ByStar to become truly widespread – a major realty at societal level – ByStar
ideology needs to resonate with societal values. As such, on large scale, ByStar will
likely be adopted in different societies to different extents.</p><p>Some of these tear points are more applicable to Eastern societies and some are more
applicable to Western societies.</p><p>We present and analyze these tear points in the context of formulation of national
policies for Eastern and Western societies.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec307" Libre-Halaal Software Based Formulation Of National Policies In Western Societies-->
<h3 id="sec307" class="subsection">17.3.4  Libre-Halaal Software Based Formulation Of National Policies In Western Societies</h3><!--SEC END --><p>While America leads Internet technology today, full adoption of ByStar
based on ByStar ideology will likely be difficult in America.</p><p>Simply put, it is naive to imagine that there is any hope that Libre-Halaal Software (or
any form of non-proprietary software) can become basis for formulation of national policies in
any Western society.</p><p>This is because of a number of a reasons, including: 
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Intellectual Property Rights regime is an integral part of Western cultures. Even
after it becomes obvious that the Western intellectual property rights regime is
corrupt, economic interests will keep it in place. In many ways this parallels the
history of Slavery in America.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Western societies are primarily economically driven. Halaal and Haraam for anything,
generally (if not always) remain fringe concepts.
</li><li class="li-itemize">The Proprietary model is fully entrenched. And the course for using the proprietary
model for internal and external exploitation is already fully charted.
</li></ul><p>In the West there is track record for where Libre-Halaal software and Internet services
fit in Western societies. The advantages of being in harmony with nature has not been
sufficient to bring GNU/Linux to the center – other than through economically driven
bastardizations of Libre-Halaal software such as Appleization, Tivoization,
Androidization, etc.</p><p>There is one aspect of halaal software and halaal Internet services that is congruent with
Western cultures. It is of course “freedom” based.</p>

Internet services model. Autonomy, privacy and liberty are being crushed.</p><p>ByStar is the cure for those Westerners who value autonomy and liberty and who recognize 
the current ills and trends.</p><p>We offer the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem and ByStar ideology to Americans the
very same way that it is being offered to all societies – there to be understood and
taken.</p>

<h3 id="sec309" class="subsection">17.3.5  Libre-Halaal Software Based Formulation Of National Policies In Eastern Societies</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Libre-Halaal software and Libre-Halaal Internet services have a much better chance of becoming a basis
for formulation of national policies in Eastern societies.</p><p>This is because of a number of reasons including: </p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Rejection of Western Intellectual Property Rights regime
is easier and more beneficial to Eastern societies. 
</li><li class="li-itemize">Eastern societies are less economically driven and the general concept of halaal and
haraam play a more significant role in Eastern societies.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Proprietary software and Proprietary Internet services are used by the West as an
instrument of exploitation and neo-colonialism against many Eastern societies in
economic and political contexts. And whom ever objects to America and the american model
is swiftly subjected to american freedom and american democracy through facebook and
twiter.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Unowned Halaal Software provides an alternative to the Proprietary American
software. The collaborative model of Halaal Software permits for collective efforts for
replacing American Proprietary Software.

<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec310" Eastern Tear Point: Full Rejection Of Western IPR Regime-->
<h4 id="sec310" class="subsubsection">Eastern Tear Point: Full Rejection Of Western IPR Regime</h4><!--SEC END --><p>Any halaal software based formulation of national policies in eastern societies
demands full rejection of the Western IPR regime.</p><p>It is much easier for Eastern societies to conclude that 
the Western IPR regime is morally wrong and that it is being 
used as an instrument of Western neo-colonialism.</p><p>Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem thrives when Western
IPR is rejected.</p><p>The full beauty and power of ByStar will not be realized, until a culture whose ideology
resonates with ByStar ideology, is ready to fully adopt ByStar.</p>
<!--TOC subsubsection id="sec311" Eastern Tear Point: Societal Autonomy-->
<h4 id="sec311" class="subsubsection">Eastern Tear Point: Societal Autonomy</h4><!--SEC END --><p>In the context of software, as an example, let’s consider the dependence of Arabs and
Iranians on American proprietary software.</p><p>Today if you want to write in Persian or in Arabic, your main choice is Microsoft’s
Proprietary-Haraam Windows environment. And in the business driven Western model,
Perso-Arabic users are always second class citizens because they represent an
insignificant market to the likes of American Microsoft and American Google. In other
words computing and communication capabilities of Perso-Arabic societies is determined by
Americans.</p><p>Eastern societies recognize this and see how Libre-Halaal Software can provide an alternative.</p><p>For example, what is maintained in <a href="http://www.persoarabic.org"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.persoarabic.org</span></a> provides an
alternative to the Proprietary Windows environment for Perso-Arabic processing. And
provides societal autonomy with respect to software for Perso-Arabic cultures.</p>

collaboration, and value chain relationships.
Libre-Halaal software and Internet Services are genuine public resources, not owned by
anyone, freely available for reuse by anyone. They are created by society/humanity, for
society/humanity.</p><p>This general proven collaborative model permits for collective efforts for replacing
American Proprietary Software which from the perspective of an Eastern society is far more
cost effective than the proprietary competitive model.</p>

that can redirect the manner-of-existence and functionality of
internet application services and protect humanity. In this
chapter we include some extracts from that document. The
description that we provide is simplified and is targetted
towards readers who have some basic software and knowledge.
</p><p>For those wishing to dig deeper into ByStar, we provide
a reading road map in <a href="http://www.by-star.net/bxRoadmap">.</a>
In ByStar Publications List<a id="hevea_default133"></a>: <a href="http://www.by-star.net/bxPublications">http://www.by-star.net/bxPublications</a>,
we provide pointers to ByStar related articles. These documents evolve
as ByStar evolves, and the publications list will be kept up-to-date.
The ByStar publications list is structured primarily for
reference.</p><p>The Internet Services
industry of today has three characteristics that greatly limit its
capabilities, its usefulness and its health.</p><p>First, virtually all existing internet Services are based on the
traditional proprietary opaque model. As yet the FOSS
movement has no formal presence within the services domain.
The internet Applications Services Provider (ASP) sits in the center
and controls and owns almost every aspect of our (user) communications.</p><p>Second, the current proprietary central model of American
internet services has taken us to live in a world where our use
of the network is mediated by organizations that often do not
have our best interests at heart. This has led to the rise of
surveillance capitalism.</p><p>Third, the Internet Services industry has arisen in a highly
disorganized, unstructured way, driven by a multitude of uncoordinated
commercial initiatives. The various industry capabilities have been
built in an <em>ad hoc</em> manner, based on immediate business
expedience, rather than by any sort of overarching engineering
design. The result is the Internet Services industry as it exists
today: chaotic, uncoordinated, and falling far short of its true
potential.</p><p>In the abstract the solution to this comprises three fundamental parts:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
We need to require the Libre-Halaal manner-of-existence for
internet services. In other words the entirety of our Internet Services
should be in internally transparent. The entire software of our own internet
services should be Libre-Halaal Software (FOSS, FLOSS, Open-Source, Free
Software).
</li><li class="li-enumerate">We need a “Universal Internet Services OS” to bring
consistency and cohesion.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">We need a “Unified Autonomy And Privacy Oriented Digital
Model” that builds on the “Universal Internet Services OS”
and provides us autonomous services — that belong to us and are controlled by us.
</li></ol><p>Here by “our” and “us” we are speaking of the society at large
when it is represented and protected by the Internet Engineering Profession.</p><p>Thus far we have been describing the contours of the problem and the
contours of solution in abstract terms. We now make them concrete based
on a specific implementation.</p><p>By building software that does not rely on central services, we
can regain control and privacy. By keeping our data under our own
control, either by maintaining possession of it in our homes or
through remote trusted possession, we gain legal protections over
it. By giving back power to the users over their networks and
systems, we are returning the internet to its intended end-to-end
and peer-to-peer architecture.</p><p>Together, the Libre-Halaal Services and By* models have enormous
implications. The Libre-Halaal Services development model, and the By*
unified services model, can transform the internet completely, from
the proprietary and <em>ad hoc</em> model of today into something far
more powerful.</p><p>The realization of this potential is large, complex and
ambitious. It is far too large in scope to be accomplished by any
one company acting alone, but instead can only be accomplished as
a coordinated industry-wide effort. But the Libre Services model
enables precisely the necessary large-scale, distributed,
cooperative effort. Libre Services brings the tremendous
collaborative power of Libre-Halaal software to the internet
application services domain.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec328" Concept Of The Universal Internet Services OS-->
<h2 id="sec328" class="section">18.1  Concept Of The Universal Internet Services OS</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Shortly after internet started to impact the society (say in
1994) and shortly after Linux became widespread, the idea of a
server-side Internet Services OS appeared as “The LAMP Stack”.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec329" The Early LAMP Precedence-->
<h3 id="sec329" class="subsection">18.1.1  The Early LAMP Precedence</h3><!--SEC END --><p>LAMP is an acronym that stands for “Linux, Apache, MySQL,
Perl/PHP/Python”. Packaged together, they create an application stack
that is both free to use and open source which functions as a general
purpose web server.</p><p>In 1994, the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) was introduced in
CERN httpd, allowing for the server-side execution of code to
create dynamic webpages. In a sense, this can be considered the
genesis of internet application services. This made it possible
to create a LAMP stack (the free general purpose web server)
using Linux, CERN httpd, and server-side programming languages
such as Perl. However, it wasn’t until the release of Postgre95
that a free database was available. Finally, in 1996, MySQL was
released online, completing the LAMP stack.</p><p>Validity of the LAMP stack as a server-side web services generic
OS was established through its widespread use in the late 1990s.
Many of the dot-con era firms ran their websites with LAMP.</p><p>We recognize what is generally labeled “The LAMP Stack” as a
very rudimentary Internet Application Services OS. LAMP had the
following characteristics.</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
LAMP was a layer on top of Linux distributions</li><li class="li-enumerate">LAMP was a server side stack</li><li class="li-enumerate">LAMP addressed a certain segment of internet application
services. Its scope was websites development.</li><li class="li-enumerate">LAMP focussed on a very specific profile of the Linux
distribution — Appache and MySql.</li><li class="li-enumerate">LAMP focussed a specific programming language —
one of Perl, PHP or Python.
</li></ol><p>Extending and improving the concept of LAMP can lead to the
notion of “A Universal Internet Services OS”.</p><p>Such an extentions involves two dimmensions:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">An Internet Services OS should cover all internet
services — not just web services</li><li class="li-enumerate">An Internet Services OS should fully cover all sides —
clients, servers and things in the middle.
</li></ol><p>By “Universal” we are refering to this notion of “covering all
sides” from phones and pads to mainframes and sever-clusters.
This idea of “Universal Services OS” builds on Debian’s concept
of “The Universal Software Operating System”.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec330" Operating Systems, Internet Application Service and Digital Ecosystem-->
<h3 id="sec330" class="subsection">18.1.2  Operating Systems, Internet Application Service and Digital Ecosystem</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Email is a widely used application service by almost everyone. To
make things more explicit, we will use email as an example of an
application service.</p><p>In Figure <a href="#fig%3AbystarAndProprietaryDEs">18.1</a>, let’s consider email in the context of
operating systems, internet application service and digital ecosystems.</p><p>First, let’s take a look at what is happening in the proprietary
universe. The five major American proprietary tech companies
(Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon) have created
five distinct digital ecosystems as competing enclaves. In
Figure <a href="#fig%3AbystarAndProprietaryDEs">18.1</a>,
<a href="#fig%3AbystarAndProprietaryDEs">18.1</a>
we are focusing on the first 3 and each of their office and email
environments. These ecosystems are mostly separate and isolated
from one another, and the economic model of these proprietary
digital ecosystems is “Surveillance Capitalism”. As such, when
users sign up for a free email account, they are voluntarily
forgoing much of their privacy. Sadly, the rest of the world is
becoming Americanized through the American Internet. Each of
these enclaves also have Mail User Agents that are fully
integrated into their digital ecosystems, providing users with
address books, calendars, time management and planning tools,
multi-lingual authoring tools, and more.</p><p>Now, let’s focus on the right side of this picture. On the
non-proprietary side, based on the FOSS model, we have
ended up with lots of components. We have Debian as a platform,
we have Emacs as an editor-centered office environment and lots
of great applications. But on the non-proprietary side we don’t
have anything that can reasonably be considered a digital
ecosystem.</p><p>We need non-proprietary digital ecosystems. And that is what
ByStar is.</p><p>In proprietary digital ecosystems, the scope of the operating
system (Chrome, Android, Windows, MacOS) is limited to the
usage-side. The service-side OS is unknown due to the proprietary
services being opaque.
On the other hand, in the FOSS side, the
scope of the LAMP style operating systems is limited to the
service-side, with the usage-side being considered agnostic.
ByStar and BISOS provide a powerful and universal solution,
covering both the service-side and the usage-side.</p><div class="center">

configured to support a particular target group out-of-the-box.
One way to understand this is a list of packages that gets
installed to provide a focus of use.”</p><p>The lower layers of BISOS can be considered a Debian Pure Blend.
BISOS-service-side has one deb-pkgs-profile and BISOS-usage-side
has another deb-pkgs-profile.</p><p>But BISOS goes beyond that. BISOS and Debian are not peers. BISOS
is a layer on top of Debian. BISOS provides services oriented
facilities that go beyon the scope of Debian. BISOS has its own
policies and practices that are a super set of Debian policies
and practices. While the basic unite of Debian is a computer,
the basic unite of BISOS is a BISOS-Site.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec337" BISOS’s Basic Unit: BISOS-Site-->
<h2 id="sec337" class="section">18.5  BISOS’s Basic Unit: BISOS-Site</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Typically the basic unit of an Operating System is one computer
— depending on the context the computer is called: a host, a
system, a platform, a box, etc.</p><p>With BISOS the basic unit is more than one computer. We call
BISOS’s basic unite: BISOS-Site. Fundamental BISOS abstractions
are based on BISOS Portable Objects (BPO) which are implemented
as git accounts. Some BPOs must be private. So, a BISOS-Site must
include a private git server — which is implemented as a Gitlab
instance. BISOS’s use of BPO is purely through a Python API
interface. Gitlab GUI is hardly ever used. BISOS also relies on
uniqueness of names and numbers. BISOS therefore needs an
automated registrar for some private names and numbers. For BISOS
to fully operate, at a minimum it needs those services.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec338" BISOS Portable Objects (BPO)-->
<h2 id="sec338" class="section">18.6  BISOS Portable Objects (BPO)</h2><!--SEC END --><p>A fundamental abstraction of BISOS is the concept of BISOS
Portable Objects (BPO). BPOs are packages of information. There
are some similarities between BPOs as packages of information and
software packages such as deb-packages or rpm-packages.</p><p>Like software packages, BPOs are named uniquely and can depend on
each other and can be collectively installed and de-installed.
BPOs are used for many things similar to how the files system is
used for many things. BPOs can be used to hold the complete
configuration information of a system. BPOs can be used to hold
configuration information for software packages. BPOs can be used
to hold private user data. BPOs can be used to hold collections
of content and source code.</p><p>For its own operation, BISOS uses various BPO types. Other types
of BPOs can be created or generic BPO types (for example the
Project type) can be used.</p><p>Each BPO consists of a number of Git Repositories (hereafter
called “repos”). Each of the BPO’s repos can be synchronized
using generic Git tools, but we use Blee/Emacs’s MaGit
exclusievely.</p><p>BPOs are implemented as Gitlab accounts. BISOS’s interactions
with Gitlab is execlusively through an API. Each Gitlab account
then can contain repos subject to common access control
mechanisms. Gitlab accounts map to BPO-Identifiers (BPO-Id). Each
BPO-id then maps to Unix non-login shell accounts. The Unix
account then becomes the base for cloning of the repos in the
coresponding Gitlab account.</p><p>Combinations of profiled deb-packages for internet application
services and their configurations in the form of BPOs can then
create Libre Services that are possestion assertable, portable
and transferable.</p>

<h2 id="sec339" class="section">18.7  BISOS Possession Assertable Libre Services (PALS)</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Based on capabilities of BPOs and the capabilities of
service-side profiled Debian packages, we can now create Libre Services.</p><p>A BISOS Libre Services can be thought of three parts:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Libre-Halaal software of the services (usually a Debian Package)
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Configuration information for the software for the service (often as a repo of a PALS-BPO)

Services between network abodes. For example, a Libre Service at
a provider can be transfered to its owner to be self-hosted.</p><p>Self-hosting is the practice of running and maintaining a Libre
Service under one’s own full control at one’s own premise. BISOS
Possession Assertable Libre Services (PALS) can be initially
self-hosted and then transfered to a Libre Service provider. PALS
can also be initially externally hosted and then become
self-hosted on demand. The concept of “transferability”
between network abodes is well supported in BISOS.</p>

<!--TOC subsection id="sec341" Ramifications Of The Libre-Halaal Edge-Oriented Strategies-->
<h3 id="sec341" class="subsection">18.7.2  Ramifications Of The Libre-Halaal Edge-Oriented Strategies</h3><!--SEC END --><p>To illustrate the privacy and autonomy oriented benefits of the
PALS model, let’s compare and contrast The American Internet with
ByStar in the context of a very simple but very important human
application: “email”. And, to be more concrete and specific, in
the context of the American Internet, let’s use the fictional
example of an American politician called “Hillary Clinton”. And
in the context of ByStar, let’s use the fictional example of an
Iranian engineer called “Mohsen Banan”.</p><p>So, in the American Internet environment, the individual typically has at least two email
addresses. One is through her work, say at the State Department, as:
“hillary.clinton@state.gov”. The other is for personal use, as:<br>
“hillary.clinton@gmail.com”. Paying attention to her email addresses, we note that
“hillary.clinton” is always on the left side of the “@”. This means that “gmail.com”
has risen in the middle and controls “hillary.clinton@” – and millions of others. This
means that Google has full possession and full control over Hillary’s personal emails.
Her “hillary.clinton@gmail.com” emails are neither autonomous nor private.
Now, since Hillary Clinton is an intelligent and powerful American politician, she has recognized
that her privacy and autonomy are important and that her email communications should be
under her full control. So, she goes ahead and sets up her own email server in her own
basement. We don’t know if that email server was based on proprietary software or not,
but we do know that as an individualistic American, she was only focused on addressing
her own email autonomy and privacy concerns. Email autonomy and privacy of society at
large was not her concern.</p><p>In the ByStar environment, the individual similarly also has two sets of email
addresses. Mohsen’s work email may well be under the control of his employer, but his
private email service and email addresses are under his own control. For personal use, Mohsen has
registered and obtained <span style="font-family:monospace">mohsen.banan.byname.net</span> for himself. Notice that while
<span style="font-family:monospace">byname.net</span> is part of ByStar, <span style="font-family:monospace">mohsen.banan.byname.net</span> belongs to Mohsen. Based on
that, he can now create a series of email addresses for himself. For example he can use
“bystarPlan@mohsen.banan.byname.net” for matters related to distribution of this document.
He can use “card@mohsen.banan.byname.net” on his visit cards.</p><p>Now, let’s compare and contrast the email addresses “hillary.clinton@gmail.com” and<br>
“myDesk@mohsen.banan.byname.net”. The right-part of the ’@’ signifies ownership and
control. The right part of ’@’ controls the left-part of ’@’. So, <span style="font-family:monospace">gmail.com</span>
controls “hillary.clinton”. While <span style="font-family:monospace">mohsen.banan.byname.net</span> controls “myDesk”
and Mohsen, own <span style="font-family:monospace">mohsen.banan.byname.net</span>. Notice that <span style="font-family:monospace">gmail.com</span> controls
millions of people through their left-part. In ByStar, millions of people can obtain their
own right-parts and then control their own left-parts — and own their own portable full email
addresses. Notice that while <span style="font-family:monospace">gmail.com</span> has positioned itself in the middle of the
network, <span style="font-family:monospace">mohsen.banan.byname.net</span> has positioned itself in the edge of the network. Longer
domain names which fully take advantage of DNS’s hierarchical design are manifestations of
edge oriented strategies.</p><p>Next, let’s compare and contrast the software of the <span style="font-family:monospace">gmail.com</span> service against
the software of<br>
<span style="font-family:monospace">mohsen.banan.byname.net</span>. The software of <span style="font-family:monospace">gmail.com</span>
service is proprietary. It belongs to Google. We don’t know what it does. When you hit the
delete button for a particular email, you can no longer see that message. But, perhaps
Google is keeping all of your deleted messages somewhere, forever. Because it is all
proprietary software, you just don’t know what is actually happening with the emails that
you may think are yours. The software of <span style="font-family:monospace">mohsen.banan.byname.net</span> services is
part of the public ByStar software. It is part of BISOS. It is a public resource. That entire software is
internally transparent. On your behalf, the engineering profession knows what it does and
what it does not. When you delete one of your own email messages, it can be known that it was
truly deleted – forever. This is what being a Libre-Halaal service means.</p><p>With ByStar in place, all Hillary Clintons of this world can have their own email
communications under their own full control. We invite Hillary Clinton to join ByStar. As
an American politician perhaps she can start thinking about solving her society’s email
problems — not just her own. We welcome her assistance in promoting ByStar.</p><p>Consider the privacy and autonomy of such edge-to-edge email communications between<br>
“myDesk@mohsen.banan.byname.net” and “myDesk@hillary.clinton.byname.net”. The mail
protocol traffic is of course end-to-end encrypted between <span style="font-family:monospace">mohsen.banan.byname.net</span> and
<span style="font-family:monospace">hillary.clinton.byname.net</span>. The message itself can additionally be encrypted. At no
point, no third party is in possession of the clear-text message. Logs of the message transfer are
only in the possession of the two edges. And all of this can be realized at internet-scale.</p><p>All ByStar individual services are intended to be edge-oriented.
They operate in the model of the edges of the network.
But, they don’t need to reside in the edge. Since ByStar individual services are
possession-assertable and portable, they can also be provisioned in the middle (as
virtual-edges). This provides for options of self-hosting or external-hosting of individual services.
So, <span style="font-family:monospace">byname.net</span> can be made to be as convenient as <span style="font-family:monospace">gmail.com</span> but yet
preserve the guarantees of autonomy and privacy through being possession-assertable,
portable, Libre-Halaal and edge-oriented.</p><p>While here we focused on the email service as an edge-oriented strategy, similar
approaches can be applied to other internet applications and intra-edge applications. In
the edge-oriented ByStar model, when you control the thermostat in your own house, that
can all happen as a ByStar intra-edge applications without loss of privacy and autonomy.</p><!--TOC section id="sec342" BISOS Model Of Platform Universality-->

<a id="sec:PyCS:BISOS'sIntegrationFramework"></a>
</p><p>Much of BISOS is about configuration and integration of related
software packages towards creation of consistent services. This
is usually done with “scripts” that augment the software
packages in a consistent way. By scripts, we mean programs that
are executed at command line. At times we also need to build
Remote Operations (RO) to accomodate remote invocation of central
services. Choice of various aspects of BISOS’s integration
framework impact functionality of BISOS as it is foundational for
BISOS.</p><p>There are three fundamental important choices to be made.</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
What programming language should we use for intgration?
</li><li class="li-enumerate">What command-line framework should we use?
</li><li class="li-enumerate">What Remote Operations (Web Services, REST, Micro Services) framework should we use?
</li></ol><p>BISOS primarily uses Python and some Bash for scripting.</p><p>There are various Python frameworks for command-line and web
services. These include click, FastAPI, Flask, RPyC and various
others. None of these provide a comprehensive enough framework
for BISOS. So, in BISOS we have taken and combined various
existing capabilities and have created our own integration
framework called “PyCS”: Python Command Services.</p><p>PyCS is rooted in the model of Expectation Complete Operations
(ECO). Local invocation of an ECO maps to command-line
invocation. Remote invocation of an ECO maps to the micro
services model and Remote Operations.</p><div class="center">

PyCS can be considered a framework for development of expectation
complete operations. Boxes under the dashed line represent
various libraries that provide general purpose features common in
general frameworks (IO, logging, error handling, configuration
management) and various libraries that represent BISOS
abstractions in Python (BPOs, PALS, PAAI).</p><p>Facilities for command line invocation are depicted above the
dashed line, on the left side of “internet”. Facilities in
support of service (Remote Operation) performers are depicted
above the dashed line, on the right side of “internet”.</p><p>Expectation complete operations are specified and implemented in
CS-Units. A CS-Multi-Unit represents a collection of CS-Units.
Notice that CS-Unit and CS-Multi-Unit boxes are replicated on
both sides of “internet”. This indicates that both commands and
remote operations map to expectation complete operations.</p><p>Each expectation complete operation is capable of describing
everything expected from the operation in full details which
includes all typing information. The information in expectation
complete operation includes:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Name of the operation
</li><li class="li-itemize">All input parameters
<ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
List of optional and mandatory parameters
</li><li class="li-itemize">List of positional arguments

<ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
All result parameters
</li><li class="li-itemize">All error parameters
</li></ul>
</li></ul><p>The information of expectation complete operation then maps to
command-line verbs, parameters and arguments. And similarly for
remote operations. The list of available verbs is specified by
the CS-Multi-Unit. Since CS-Multi-Units are capables of
describing all of the expectations of all of their operations,
very powerful automated user interfaces for invocation of
operations can be built. The “CS Player” box in
Figure <a href="#fig%3ApycsAnatomy">??</a>
illustrates that.</p><p>Remote operations are implemented using RPyC. RPyC or Remote
Python Call, is a transparent library for symmetrical remote
procedure calls, clustering, and distributed-computing. Use of
RPyC is depicted with the line going through the vertical box
labeled “internet”. Names used by invokers and performers are
shown in the boxes labeld “RO-Sap” (Remote Operation Service
Access Point).</p><p>PyCS framework provides a solid foundation for transformation of
software into services and integration of software and services in BISOS.</p>

ByStar services can thus be greatly enhanced by providing the user
with a “matched” environment—a user environment that is closely

and capabilities that go far beyond what is possible using the
traditional generic browser access.</p><p>By fully integrating BISOS and Blee we accomplish a degree of cohesion and conviviality
within the ByStar Digital Ecosystem that is absent in the American internet

Figure <a href="#fig%3AbleeCentricPerspectiveOfBxDE">18.7</a> as a containment
hierarchy. The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystems contains
both Usage-Side BISOS platforms and Service-Side BISOS platforms.
The Usage-Side BISOS platform contains Blee. And Blee contains
Emacs.</p><p>Emacs is a 40-plus years old editor centered usage environment,
with a Lisp engine at its core and an extremely powerful display
and editing engine in its nucleus. Emacs is one of the oldest
Free Software in continuous use. Over the past 40 plus years,
sophisticated engineers have added support for anything and
everything to Emacs. Emacs’s well designed fundamental
abstractions make it the most convivial usage environment. Emacs
is a multi-lingual editor that supports most human languages.
But, out of the box, Emacs is clunky and difficult to use.</p><p>Blee serves two purposes:
</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Blee integrates with BISOS and ByStar services and ByStar concepts.

contains a very powerful display engine, a very powerful Lisp
engine, a very powerful input methods engine and a very powerful

textual environment. But it is more than that. Emacs is now
capable handling multimedia (images/audio/video) as well. Emacs’s
display engine supports bidirectional (bidi) text and is fully
multilingualized. Emacs supports input methods for many human
languages. Emacs’s Lisp engine and its applications development
framework allows for convenient development and customization of
applications.</p><p>Blee then builds on Emacs.</p><div class="center">

features of Blee. For each of the programming languages of BISOS
(Python, Bash, Elisp, LaTeX, Web environment and C/C++) Blee
provides Interactive Development Environments (IDEs) that go
beyond the language and include the frameworks and libraries.</p><p>All coding and all writing in BISOS is based on a model called:
COMEEGA (Collaborative Org Mode Enhanced Emacs Generalized Authorship).</p><p>Think of COMEEGA as the “Inverse Of Literate Programming”. You
write in the native programming mode but then augment your code
with org-mode comments and org-mode doc-strings. Your code then
becomes two things. The code itself and a document. Blee-COMEEGA
then provides switch between the native-mode and org-mode
conveniently. COMEEGA applies to all of the code in BISOS and
Blee which leads to a large degree of consistency.</p><p>Usage of BISOS’s Integration Framework (PyCS) that we described
in Section <a href="#sec%3APyCS%3ABISOS%27sIntegrationFramework">18.9</a> is
facilitied in Blee through Blee Command Services Players. Since
each Command Service — be it a command-line or a
remote-operation (micro-service) — is expectations complete,
through Blee we run them more conveniently.</p><p>Of course, all of BISOS and Blee is self-documented. The
documentation takes the form of Blee-Org-Panels which take the
form of related org-files. Unlike typical documentation, Blee Org
Panels are active. You can modify, configure and customize BISOS
and Blee from within Blee-Org-Panels. Additionally
Blee-Org-Panels can be used by users to organize their own
information and applications.</p><p>All of the key abstractions of BISOS (BPO, PALS, PAAI, AAS), can
be managed through Blee.</p><p>The combination of Blee and BISOS fully wraps development,
management and usage of ByStar services. Such universality
facilitates continuous growth of ByStar.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec345" Native Uses Of BISOS In ByStar Digital Ecosystem-->
<h2 id="sec345" class="section">18.11  Native Uses Of BISOS In ByStar Digital Ecosystem</h2><!--SEC END --><p>ByStar’s primary offerings are real, tangible and practical autonomy and privacy – on very
large scale. The scope of ByStar is everything. The “*” in By* comes from Unix’s glob expansion symbol.
All ByStar services are unified and consistent. The integrated facilities of ByStar are
intended to be used by a very large segment of population on this planet.</p><p>In terms of richness of services, ByStar capabilities are vast — paralleling most of
what exists in the proprietary internet today.
But, there are two fundamental differences:
</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
the ownership model of the service — proprietary vs Libre-Halaal
</li><li class="li-enumerate">the manner of deployment and usage of the services — rise-of-the-middle vs edge-oriented
</li></ol><p>
These in turn have immense ramifications on autonomy and privacy of the individual.
The technology used to deliver ByStar
services is often based on existing open-source software.
ByStar
does not limit or reduce any of the positive aspects of the existing internet. By changing
the model, it alleviates the negative privacy and autonomy threats.</p><p>ByStar does not intend to displace the American internet immediately. It is an
evolutionary strategy. The Libre-Halaal ByStar digital ecosystem exists in parallel with
the proprietary American digital ecosystem, but with separate values. Through out this
exposition, we compare and contrast ByStar with “The American Internet.” By that we
mean, the proprietary American digital ecosystem as it exists today as a set of internet
application services dominated by American corporations and the American model. We fully endorse the global equal
access model of internet at layer 3. It is the exclusive rise-of-the-middle American model
of internet at layer 7 that we reject.</p><p>Key concepts underlying the model of the Libre-Halaal ByStar digital ecosystem include:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
ByStar is about redecentralization of the internet. Control and ownership
is transferred from central corporations to distributed individuals (as autonomous entities).
Rise-of-the-middle model is rejected in favor of the autonomous edges model.
</li><li class="li-itemize">ByStar software and internet services are un-owned/publicly-owned and internally transparent. All
ByStar software is Libre-Halaal software subjected
to AGPL. The entirety of ByStar Individual Services can be reproduced based on
their available sources.</li><li class="li-itemize">Broadly speaking, ByStar services fall into these 3 categories:
<ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
ByStar Individual (Possession-Assertable/Autonomous) Services.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">ByStar Content Syndication Services.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">ByStar Facilitated Direct and Assisted Inter-Autonomous Interaction Services.
</li></ol></li><li class="li-itemize">ByStar individual services represent real individuals in the real world.
In ByStar, real individuals have real autonomy, real control and real ownership of their own ByStar individual services.
ByStar individual services are edge-oriented and can be externally-hosted or self-hosted.
When externally hosted, ByStar individual services are regulated to be portable
and possession-assertable. For example, my ByStar individual services is:<br>
 <span style="font-family:monospace">mohsen.1.banan.byname.net</span>.
You can have your own as: <span style="font-family:monospace">first.last.byname.net</span>.
Since you own your domain and since you can fully possess the service and your data at will, you have real autonomy.</li><li class="li-itemize">ByStar individual services are “Possession-Assertable”. A portable
hosted service can be transferred to the individual who owns it where the
individual becomes her own Application Service Provider. For example, people can run
their own fully private email servers in their own houses. Just like Hillary
Clinton.<p>Some early examples of ByStar possession-assertable individual service factory domains are:
<span style="font-family:monospace">ByName.net</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">ByFamily, BySMB, ByMemory, ByAlias, ByWhere, ByAuthor, ByArtist</span>.</p></li><li class="li-itemize">Direct inter-autonomous relations such as Facebook style photo sharing are accomplished
through the individual’s own possession-assertable authorization services (individualized OAuth services).</li><li class="li-itemize">Syndication services such as Youtube style content publication are clearly regulated and
integrated with ByStar content production capabilities of individual services.
Some early examples of ByStar syndication services are:
<span style="font-family:monospace">ByTopic, ByContent, ByLookup, ByEvent, BySource, ByBinary, BySearch</span>.</li><li class="li-itemize">Facilitated inter-autonomous interaction services such as dating,
auction and trade services, are clearly regulated and well integrated with
ByStar identity services.
Some early examples of ByStar inter-autonomous facilitated interaction services are:<br>
 <span style="font-family:monospace">ByInteraction, ByHookUp, ByEntity</span>.</li><li class="li-itemize">ByStar also functions as a hierarchical registrar. For example, Mohsen Banan’s
registration of<br>
<span style="font-family:monospace">mohsen.1.banan.byname.net</span> with the <span style="font-family:monospace">byname.net</span> registrar results in ownership of<br>
<span style="font-family:monospace">mohsen.1.banan.byname.net</span> by Mohsen Banan. This domain registration is independent of
the service provider that is hosting the portable and possession-assertable individual service.
Combination of the portable owned domain and the portability of publicly-owned ByStar individual services
allows for transparent transfer of an individual service from one hosting service to another hosting service.
This accomplishes the equivalent of Wireless Local Number Portability.
Such fundamental user freedoms are absent in the American internet.</li><li class="li-itemize">ByStar is mostly self-regulated. Upon assertion by the user-owner, the ByStar individual service
provider must fully and permanently delete the possession-asserted service and all her data.
Or otherwise, ab initio let the owner know that her data will be maintained. Within applicable
jurisdictions, ByStar service providers must comply with Lawful Interception (LI)
and satisfy regulatory requirements and legal obligations towards the Law
Enforcement Agencies. Syndication and facilitated inter-autonomous relation
providers are subject to known and clear regulations and restrictions.</li><li class="li-itemize">In ByStar individual services, the individual’s data is encapsulated as
ByStar-Portable-Objects (BPOs) — implemented as private git repos.
Possession-assertability, portability-of-service, edge-orientation, Libre-Halaalness and
portable-objects paradigm of ByStar create an environment where ByStar individual
services can be easily updated and reproduced from scratch. This provides and
additional dimension to improved security of ByStar.</li><li class="li-itemize">BISOS, ByStar Internet Services Operating System, is the software framework
that is used for usage and integration through out all of ByStar. BISOS functions as a
layer on top of Unix that elevates conviviality of Unix to integration, configuration and usage of internet services.</li><li class="li-itemize">Blee, ByStar Libre-Halaal Emacs Environment, is ByStar’s primary usage environment.
Blee is fully integrated with BISOS. Blee is multi-lingual and well supports most human languages and scripts.

</p><p>At societal scale, having recognized that the Western IPR regime
is fundamentally fraudulent, there are two basic strategies that
we can adopt to attempt to cure our societies.</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Inside of IPR Libre-Halaal Strategies</span>.<p>Inside of IPR, we can empahsize public copyright licenses
and invest in the FOSS and copyleft content inside of the
existing Western IPR regime. We can cultivate the Libre
Services models and frameworks inside of the existing
Western IPR regime. Such approaches are practical and
will produce positive outcomes. Such strategies are
insufficient to have a meterial impact on health of
society. In a sense, this has been and is status quo in
America and in the West and the rest of the world.</p><p>The main problem with the inside of IPR Libre-Halaal
strategy is that in parallel with the Libre-Halaal
positive progress, there will also be negative IPR based
progress. The dominant negative IPR based progress will
render the minor positive Libre-Halaal based progress
irrelevant.</p></li><li class="li-enumerate"><span style="font-weight:bold">Outside of IPR Libre-Halaal Strategies</span>.<p>Outside of IPR, at societal level, we can fully reject
the Western IPR regime and call for the abolition of IPR.
Avoid the likes of WIPO, Berne Convention, WTO, TRIPS,
GATT, GATS and the rest of such restrictions and
agreements. Consider patent and copyright laws invalid
and instead create other laws for proper governance of
polyexistentials. This can result in fundamental change
and if done properly can be a cure to the problems that
we are seeing in the Western IPR model. But it can be
very costly.</p><p>Costs of outside of IPR Libre-Halaal strategies take the
form of vast economic trade sanctions. Western IPR regime is
enforced through general trade agreements.</p></li></ol><p>The problem with (1) — Inside of IPR Libre-Halaal Strategies
— is that it is too limited and its imapct is marginal. Yet its
execution is straight forward and well established and partical.
Therefore, it should be well supported both in Western and
Eastern societies.</p><p>The problem with (2) — Outside of IPR Libre-Halaal Strategies
— is that it is difficult to execute as it demands becoming
separate from the West. Westerners have fully merged intelectual
property with the rest of the global trade agreements to such an
extent that in practice rejecting IPR equates to full isolation and
separation from the West. In many cases, adoption of (2) as a
strategy amounts to a global uprising!</p><p>In this part, we will explore (2) — Outside of IPR Libre-Halaal
Strategies — in Eastern societies. We don’t believe that it is
realistic to consider (2) viable in Western societies. In the
West calling for abolition of IPR is mostly symbolic. In
Chapter <a href="#NOTYET">??</a> we focus on Western strategies. In
Chapter <a href="#NOTYET">??</a> we focus on strategies for Eastern societies
in general with Iran and China as special cases.</p><p>Depening on how a society is structured and its belief system,
there are certain things that it can do well and there are things
that it can not do so well and there are things that it simply
can not do.</p><p>IPR is a keystone ingredient of structure and of the belief
system of Western societies. It shapes the entire ecosystem of
the West. It permits Westerners to do certain things very well
and it prevents them from doing other things. Deterioration of
digital autonomy and digital privacy is due to IPR as a keystone
ingredient. Real digital autonomy and real digital privacy are
not achievable in IPR based ecosystems.</p><p>In biology, a keystone species is an organism that helps define
an entire ecosystem. Without its keystone species, the ecosystem
would be dramatically different or cease to exist altogether.
Keystone species have low functional redundancy.</p><p>As a paralell to biology, in sociology we consider IPR a keystone
ingredient. Without IPR, society will be very different. This has
not happened anywhere yet and is therefore difficult to imagine.
As we have shown, IPR is an ownership mistake. Without it, we
will have a much healthier society. American slavery was a
keystone ingredient of American society. Without slavery,
American society became dramatically different.</p><p>It is at this scope and at this scale that we want to explore
rejection of Western IPR regime.</p><p>Things have been arranged a particular way. Recognizing, the fact
that things can be rearranged differently is not in the interest of
the most Westerners.
David Graeber, In
“The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy”,
[<a href="#NOTYET"></a>], points to this in a number of occasions:</p><blockquote class="quote">
“the ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that
we make, and could just as easily make differently.”<p>...</p><p>“the hidden reality of human life is the fact that the world doesn’t
just happen. It isn’t a natural fact, even though we tend to treat it
as if it is — it exists because we all collectively produce it.”</p><p>...</p><p>“It’s not just that some people get to break the rules — it’s that
loyalty to the organization [or system] is to some degree measured by one’s
willingness to pretend this isn’t happening.”
</p></blockquote><p>We want to rearrange things differently, so that the society is
no longer in conflict with the nature of polyexistentials.</p><p>All previous sections of this document have been towards this:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">

adoption of the Libre-Halaal model. A deep understanding of the
nature of polyexistentials leads to the realization that societal
and national policies must be consistent and in harmony with the
halaal manner-of-existence of polyexistentials.</p><p>In this part we focus on such cultivations with a narrow focus on

<h2 id="sec348" class="section">19.1  Build Consensus On Invalidity Of IPR</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Earlier in this book, we established that the concept of Western
IPR is fundamentally invalid. However, providing proper logic on a
subject to a reader is different from creating societal consensus
on that subject. Each society needs to arrive at that conclusion
on its own and through its own processes. Books such as this can
help, but they are not sufficient.</p><p>Even in an authoritarian society, it is not necessary to arrive
at invalidity and the need for abolishment of IPR through
decrees. IPR is invalid and people can get to that conclusion
through independent thinking and discussions. They simply need to
be guided.</p><p>Part one of this book establishes invalidity of IPR. In Part two,
we debunk most arguments made in favor of IPR. The references
section of this book includes a large number of books and
articles that recognize invalidity of IPR. But, at societal
scale, in the West none of these will have a material impact. The
reason why Western societies are not convinced is because they
are vested in it. It is not in their interest to understand it.</p><p>Moslem societies can arrive to that consensus
both through public
discussions and through discussions among
sources of immitation. Imam Khomeini’s logic is crisp and fully
aligns with our logic. We have pointed to this in Parts two and
three of this book.</p><p>The Chinese have done many studies.
Chinese academics know that there is no evidence to support that
IPR is good for economy or for innovation.</p><p>Any society wishing to arrive at the consensus on invalidity of
IPR, should encourage public discussions on this topic on
national TV, national radio and elsewhere. Keep in mind that the
burden of proof should be on those who advocate IPR.</p>

<h2 id="sec349" class="section">19.2  Evaluate Merits Of National Withdrawals From IPR Agreements</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Having established societal consensus on invalidity of
IPR societal consensus on invalidity of IPR is one thing, acting
on that consensus is another.</p><p>Right now, many people think that making illegal copies of
copyrighted matterial is unethical. When there is societal
consensus on invalidity of IPR, it is the copyright law which is
unethical. Copying is your natural right. With that correct
mindset in place, there is a great deal more that can be done.</p><p>The ultimate national action for rejection of the Western IPR
regime is withdrawal from the many West dominated global
trade agreements. Any society daring to fully reject the Western IPR
regime will be subjected to the full wrath of American and
Western sanctions.</p><p>IP is an integral part of many West dominated global trade
agreements and rejection of Western IPR regime results in being
removed from many global trade agreements. This may not be in
national interest.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec350" Promulgate Libre-Halaal For National Governance Of Polyexistentials-->
<h2 id="sec350" class="section">19.3  Promulgate Libre-Halaal For National Governance Of Polyexistentials</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Polyexistentials will dominate the future.
Many crucial national policies need to be made to deal
with polyexistentials.</p><p>Once illegitimacy of IPR has been established, abolishment of the
Western IPR regime should not lead to anarchy.
Recognizing the importance of polyexistentials, at the highest level of
societal governance — The Leader, Sources Of Imitation, President, National Legislators —
need to take on the question of:<br>
What is the halaal manner-of-existence of polyexistentials?</p><p>We answered that question earlier, briefly:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">For each polyexistential (digitals, software, movies,
pharmaceuticals, etc) Halaal manner-of-existence of that
polyexistential should be determined by ethicists (The Leader,
Sources Of Imitation, etc) and the profession of that
polyexistential. Clear definitions for Halaal manner-of-existence
of each polyexistential is needed.</li><li class="li-itemize">For Software in particular, we have offered our criteria for
halaal manner-of-existence of software as “Libre-Halaal Software” as outlined in
Section
<a href="#sec%3ALibre-HalaalSoftware--HalaalManner-of-ExistenceofSoftware">??</a> –

and at <a href="http://www.HalaalSoftware.org"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.HalaalSoftware.org</span></a></li><li class="li-itemize">For Content in particular, we have offered our criteria for
halaal manner-of-existence of content as “Libre-Halaal Content as outlined in
Section
<a href="#sec%3ANOTYET">??</a> –
sec:Libre-HalaalSoftware–HalaalManner-of-ExistenceofSoftware.</li><li class="li-itemize">For Internet Application Services in particular, we have offered our
criteria for halaal manner-of-existence of internet services as
“Libre-Halaal Internet Services” as outlined in Section
<a href="#sec%3ALibre-HalaalInternetServices--HalaalManner-Of-ExistenceofInternetServices">??</a> –

and at <a href="http://www.LibreServices.org"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.LibreServices.org</span></a>
</li></ul><p>In the Western IPR model, this is the equivalent of saying that
all software should be subjected to the AGPL and all content
should be subject to the Attribution-ShareAlike license and that
there are no other licenses and that by default all software and
all content is such. Some Westerners consider this as the
desired ultimate ethical environment.</p><p>In the inside of IPR strategies, some individuals may subject
their work to Libre-Halaal licenses through which we end up with
some Libre-Halaal polyexistentals. In the outside of IPR
strategies, all polyexistentals are Libre-Halaal by default.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec351" Legislate Constraints On Delivery Of Libre Services Types-->
<h2 id="sec351" class="section">19.4  Legislate Constraints On Delivery Of Libre Services Types</h2><!--SEC END --><p>For internet application services, it is not sufficient to just
define the proper manner-of-existence of internet application
services as Libre Services.</p><p>It is also necessary to constrain the operation of various types
of Libre Services. For example, a PALS (Possession Assertable
Libre Services) operator should transfer all data to its owner
and then destroy all copies of data when demanded by the owner.</p><p>For other types of Libre Services there are other constrains
imposed on the operator. See Section <a href="#NOTYET">??</a>.</p><p>In the inside of IPR strategies, imposition of constraints such
as PALS, can only take the form of service agreements similar to
existing Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Such a model has little
chance of becoming widespread at societal level unless the
society values the importance and benefits of autonomy and privacy.</p><p>In the outside of IPR strategies, since proper
manner-of-existence of internet application services as Libre
Services are already established/legislated, additional
constraints on the Libre Service operators through legislation is
practical.</p><p>There are parallel types of legislation in the monoexistential realm.
For example for Safety Deposit Boxes in State Of Washington, we have:</p><blockquote class="quote"><p>RCW [Revised Code of Washington] 22.28.030</p><p>Exercise of due care required.</p><p>Whenever any safe deposit company shall let or lease any vault,
safe, box or other receptacle for the keeping or storage of
personal property such safe deposit company shall be bound to
exercise due care to prevent the opening of such vault, safe, box
or receptacle by any person other than the lessee thereof, or his
or her duly authorized agent, and the parties may provide in
writing the terms, conditions, and liabilities in the lease.
Authorized agent as used in this section includes, but is not
limited to, a duly appointed personal representative, an
attorney-in-fact, a special representative, or a trustee acting
under a revocable living trust.</p></blockquote><p>In the mid 1980s, among System Administrators, we used to have
ethical conventions such as “Thou shalt not snoop”.
Simply put, it meant: Do not spy on another person’s computer data.</p><p>In the 2020s, we are advocating for formal legislation of
operation of Libre Services.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec352" Replace The Patent Office With The Inventions Registration Office-->
<h2 id="sec352" class="section">19.5  Replace The Patent Office With The Inventions Registration Office</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Patents and copyright work very differently. With regard to
copyright, we are saying that it should be fully abolished. The
copying rules are defined by proper manner-of-existence of
specific polyexistentals at societal level and attribution for
creation can be accomplished through public ledgers.</p><p>Patents are wrong as a form of ownership but not as a mechanism
for attribution. Patents enforce attribution through ownership.
We want to abolish the ownership aspect but keep the attribution
aspect.</p><p>It makes good sense to have a registration for inventions which
attributes inventions to inventors.</p><p>Further, in the inside of IPR strategies phase, it makes sense to
convert internal registrations into external patents.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec353" Create An Infrastructure For Attribution Based Economy (ABE)-->
<h2 id="sec353" class="section">19.6  Create An Infrastructure For Attribution Based Economy (ABE)</h2><!--SEC END --><p>In Section refNOTYET we described the concept of Attribution
Based Economy (ABE).</p><p>By rejecting Western IPR we are rejecting ownership of
polyexistentials. In the Libre-Halaal model, attribution of
polyexistentials to their creators (authors) is essential.
Economic models that fairly evaluate the value of the
polyexistential and the significance of various contributors in
creation of the polyexistential need to be cultivated.</p><p>In the early days, governments need to play a role in creation of
needed structures for the infrastructure of Attribution Based Economy.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec354" National Adoption Of Libre-Halaal Digital Ecosystems-->
<h2 id="sec354" class="section">19.7  National Adoption Of Libre-Halaal Digital Ecosystems</h2><!--SEC END --><p>In Part 4-NOTYET — Libre-HalaalDE-NOTYET, we present
the contours a specific Libre-Halaal digital ecosystem, named:
“The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem”.</p><p>The natural scope of ByStar is global. ByStar can be deployed and
used as an Inside of IPR Libre-Halaal Strategy. The copyright
public license for software of the ByStar services is AGPL.
Americans and Europeans can deploy and use ByStar services as
they use other internet application services. With ByStar they
get real and tangible autonomy and privacy.</p><p>Use of ByStar as an “Outside of IPR Libre-Halaal Strategy” is a
great deal more effective. In the ByStar model each nation and
each culture adopts and nationalizes the publicly owned (humanity
owned) global ByStar digital ecosystem software consistent with
its own values — while preserving the universal ByStar model of
autonomy and privacy of the individual. This is very different
from the proprietary American model of exploitation and this is
also very different from national reactions and responses to the
proprietary American model.</p><p>Let’s take the case of email at societal scale inside of IPR
model. In the proprietary American model, we have the likes of
the central corporate owned and opperated Gmail.com. As of 2023,
Gmail is the most popular email platform with over 1.8 billion
users worldwide — and roughly a 30% market share. Overwhelming
majority of Gmail users are outside of US — and the American
Google is watching over all of that. About 333.3 billion Gmail
emails were sent and received daily in
2022. <sup><a id="text23" href="#note23">1</a></sup></p><p>Now Let’s consider what email can be at societal scale outside of
the IPR model. In the Libre-Halaal ByStar digital ecosystem,
email is realized as a PALS (Possession Assertable Libre
Service). This means that each individual can own her own email
service. She can choose to delegate operation of her email
service to a service provider and have the equivalent convenience
of Gmail. Or possess the services herself, like Hilary Clinton.
The PALS model allow for that degree of transferability and
transportability. Details of how PALS works is described in
Section <a href="#NOTYET">??</a>.</p><p>Further let’s consider what adoption of national email based on
the PALS model of Libre-Halaal ByStar can look like. Let’s take
the hypotetical case of Iran. To make sure that every Iranian
citizen has access to autonomous and private email, the Iranian
government creates a domain for every citizen in the form of,
say: <span style="font-family:monospace">selNu.firstName.lastName.name.ir</span>. The selNu is a
unique identifier that the government can assign —
corresponding to national id-cards for example. The
<span style="font-family:monospace">selNu.firstName.lastName.name.ir</span> domain would now belong
to the individual. The name-servers for that domain will be
chosen and controlled by the individual (not the government).
Free of charge, the Iranian government will provide PALS services
for individuals who wish to have their email PALS service
transfered in or out of the government provided PALS service.
With her domain under her own control, the individual can now use
the local-part of the email address syntax to create as many
email addresses as she wishes. For example,
<span style="font-family:monospace">work@selNu.firstName.lastName.name.ir</span> or
<span style="font-family:monospace">school@...</span>. That need not be the individual’s only
domain, similarly other domains and addresses can be used. For
example, the author of this book has chosen to use
<span style="font-family:monospace">plpc-120033@mohsen.1.banan.byname.net</span> for matters
related to this book.</p><p>Consider the differences between the proprietary American
Gmail.com email service and the nationalized Libre-Halaal PALS
based name.ir email service. gmail.com is an opaque service,
while name.ir is transparent. gmail.com is central while name.ir
is highly distributed. With gmail.com your address is locked to
the Gmail service. With name.ir your address is portable and
transferable. gmail.com is privacy crushing. name.ir is privacy
cherishing.</p><p>From a societal perspective, consider the email medium for say a
high school student. Should the rest of the world become like
Americans and Westerners?</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec355" National Public Sector Libre-Halaal Policies And Strategies-->
<h2 id="sec355" class="section">19.8  National Public Sector Libre-Halaal Policies And Strategies</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Outside of America, the current software and internet application
services landscape is a mess and humiliating. Outside of America,
American internet corporations function as the surveillance and
propaganda arms of the U.S. government and its American values.
As of 2022, almost 90% of Facebook’s daily active users come
from outside the US. When necessary, American internet
corporations happily collaborate with the US government towards
foreign espionage and foreign exploitations. American
internet services can not be fixed on its fringes, it should be avoided.</p><p>Earlier we recognized polyexistentals as public goods.
Replacing the IPR model with the Libre-Halaal model demands much
larger public sector involvement and investment in research and development.</p><p>For Eastern societies, the costs and consequences of not having a
national polyexistential/digital policy are immense. In the
absence of a national polyexistential/digital policy, the West
dictates and the East must follow. Americans control the likes of
Facebook<a id="hevea_default135"></a>’s interpersonal communication
conventions and Easterners conform.</p><p>When such fundamental aspects of human behavior are determined by
the West, Eastern models and values will be crushed in due
course. Having independent Eastern national
polyexistential/digital policies is a matter of survival.</p><p>This matter of survival amounts to “Model Wars”. In the realm
of polyexistentials IPR and halaal manner-of-existence of
polyexistentials are at war. The results of this models war at
that basic level, can indirectly impact other significant aspects
of life models.</p><p>Libre-Halaal software and Libre-Halaal Internet services have a
much better chance of becoming a basis for formulation of
national policies in Eastern societies.</p><p>This is because of a number of reasons including:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
Rejection of Western Intellectual Property Rights regime
is easier and more beneficial to Eastern societies.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Eastern societies are less economically driven and the general concept of halaal and
haraam play a more significant role in Eastern societies.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Proprietary software and Proprietary Internet services are used by the West as an
instrument of exploitation and neo-colonialism against many Eastern societies in
economic and political contexts. And whom ever objects to America and the American model
is swiftly subjected to American freedom and American democracy through <a id="hevea_default136"></a>Facebook and
<a id="hevea_default137"></a>Twitter.
</li><li class="li-itemize">Unowned Libre-Halaal Software provides an alternative to the Proprietary American
software. The collaborative model of Libre-Halaal Software permits for collective efforts for
replacing American Proprietary Software.

alternative to the proprietary Microsoft Windows operating system.</p><p>Viewing Linux as a universal operating system, spanning embedded
devices and handsets, as well as desktops and mainframes is very
reasonable. Based on this a unified “Universal Linux Everywhere

Software In Iran”. And if the public sector was to require the
“Universal Linux Everywhere Strategy”, the evolution of private

<a id="chap:TheoreticalWesternSocietalCures"></a>

</p><p>All the tangible autonomy and privacy oriented capabilities and
the engineering potentials of the ByStar Libre-Halaal Digital
Ecosystem that we have described is publicly available to all.
Americanists, Westerners and Easterners can profit from them
equally.</p><p>But, those tangible capabilities and engineering solutions can
not be considered societal cures unless societal leaders, policy
makers and legislators buy into them.</p><p>In our model, in the end, the cure requires rejection of Western
IPR regime and adoption of the Libre-Halaal model.</p><p>Is this a realistic possibility for the American society?
We don’t think so.</p><p>Dynamics of established IPR regime and Americanism are deeply
rooted and can not be realistically changed in the foreseeable
future in America. Americans have invested heavily in their IPR model
and it is not in their interest to recognize their mistakes.</p><p>With respect to autonomy and privacy, Western models in general
and the American internet model in particular are fundamentally
conflicted and contradictory. On the one hand, they promote the
IPR regime that transfers more power and more control to
corporations which in turn makes them better positioned to
exploit the individual and her privacy. On the other hand, they
come up with a day late and a dollar short type of regulations
the likes of the European General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) or the Californian Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which fail
to recognize that since data and service are usually intertwined,
control and ownership of both should be transferred to the user
— not just the data.</p><p>Westerners fail to understand that the IPR regime directly and
indirectly diminishes autonomy and privacy of individuals. Real
privacy, demands real autonomy. Real autonomy demands that
individual services be in full control of the individual. Full
control of individual services, requires that software and
services be internally transparent and publicly owned. But, IPR
is an instrument of exclusivity and makes software and services
internally opaque and corporate owned.</p><p>We can also walk through the ramification of IPR on the
individual’s privacy in the other direction. IPR, as an
instrument of exclusivity, empowers the corporation to exploit
the individual’s autonomy and privacy. We then end up exactly
where we are, with American internet and surveillance capitalism.
IPR and surveillance capitalism are directly linked, in
opposition to nature and humanity.</p><p>While rejecting the Western IPR regime, the Libre-Halaal ByStar
Digital Ecosystem can co-exist in parallel with the American
internet. However, ByStar can thrive much better in societal
environments that fully reject and abolish the Western IPR
regime.</p><p>From the very beginning our main goals have been two fold:</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
Bring about the understanding that Western IPR is best
framed as a societal disease
</li><li class="li-enumerate">Offer realistic societal cures to the Western IPR disease
</li></ol><p>The metaphor of Disease is quite useful in that it also provides
us metaphors of: Patient, Cure, Spreading of the disease,
Symptoms, Patient Zero, Quarantine and Diagnosis.</p><p>Building on these mataphors, doctors know that there is not much
that they can do if the patient is not willing to recognize that
he is sick. In order to cure a disease, the patient needs to
recognize that he is sick and he needs to desire to be healed.
Americans and Americanists in particular and Westerners in
general do not a problem with their IPR. For now, most
Americanists believe that Western IPR regime works well and that
the rest of the world should follow them. Some of the
Americanists who believe that there may be something wrong with
IPR, also beleive that the American model is very dynamic and is
capable of correcting itself when needed. Those Americanists
often willingly forget or whitewash their history.</p><p>In Section <a href="#NOTYET">??</a>, we recognized patient zero from which
the disease is spreading. Americanists reject our diagnosis of
the Western IPR as a societal disease. In such a scenario, it is
best that we avoid and neglect that patient.</p><p>Instead, it is best that we focus on preventing the spread of the
disease and focus on curing those who are willing to recognize
the disease and who can be persuaded to want to be cured. This is

<h2 id="sec363" class="section">20.1  Neglecting The American Society</h2><!--SEC END --><p>We don’t consider rejection of the IPR regime and adoption of the
Libre-Halaal model a viable possibility in America.
For the American society, we have no specific suggestions and
recommendations towards a cure. Unlike the rest of the civilized
world, in America, market driven health care and TV advertised
prescription drugs are the norm. Each of those TV advertised
prescription drugs is for a set of patents.</p><p>We will watch the evolution of the American society with repect
to guns. Clearly the cure for IPR comes after the cure for
persistent and common mass shootings.</p><p>Even then, within the Western IPR regime we fully intend to
advocate the adoption of the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital
Ecosystems. Some Americans recognize the need for autonomy and
privacy and for those, the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystems
can be a solution.</p><p>Hypothetically, much of what we describe in the next chapter as
Eastern societal cures may offend some Americanists. As US
citizens, we believe that activism in this area is in America’s
interest, because absolute support for the IPR regime is wrong.
The expected American response to the Eastern scenarios that we
suggest will likely be that of crushing them and perhaps
crushing us. It is best to consider ramifications of the
scenarios that we are mentioning as natural. Fighting nature is
not the right thing to do.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec364" Can There Be A Political West Sans America?-->
<h2 id="sec364" class="section">20.2  Can There Be A Political West Sans America?</h2><!--SEC END --><p>In Europe, in Japan, in South Korea and in India, TV
advertisements for prescription drugs is illegal. Persistent mass
shootings are also not common in those societies.
So, in many ways the rest of the political West is different from
America.</p><p>Could rejection of the IPR regime and adoption of the
Libre-Halaal model be considered a viable possibility for the
rest of the politica West?</p><p>The answer to that question is very likely no as well. America
will not permit it. Rejection of IPR regime requires separation
from America.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec365" Europe Sans America?-->
<h3 id="sec365" class="subsection">20.2.1  Europe Sans America?</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Philosophy, ethics and values of our French cousins are clearly
different from our American friends. It could well be that the
logic and directions that we described in this book would
resonate more with our French cousins.</p><p>It is difficult to say how deeply the Europeans have understood
the harms of their Western IPR and Americanism. Most of what they
say and do is imitations, reactions and bandaids.</p><p>Europeans have figured out that public sector investment in
digital domain research is the right thing. So, there are
research organizations such as Inria. Shortly after that we get
to Inria and Meta engaging in collaborative research. The French
used to be able to recognize that things like Facebook should not
even exist. What happened to independent European thinking?</p><p>The Europeans think that the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) is the toughest privacy and security law in the world.
That becomes kind of funny when you consider that:
</p><blockquote class="quote">
The US National Security Agency [NSA] tapped phone calls
involving German chancellor Angela Merkel and her closest
advisers for years [perhaps decades] and spied on the staff of
her predecessors, according to WikiLeaks.
</blockquote><p>What we are saying in this book is different from the strength of
the likes of GDPR regulations. We believe that the best way to
remain private and protect your own data is to possess it
yourself. In the Libre-Halaal regulations play an important
peripheral role. Privacy oriented engineering is central. Let’s
consider your emails as an example. If your email service is
Libre-Halaal and if it is realized as a Possession Assertable
Libre Service (PALS) then in practice you and only possess your
emails.</p><p>Through the likes of the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem,
large American companies (Google) need not even possess our data
— in which case much of GDPR is no longer needed. We are saying
that IPR based models like Gmail should not exist. We are
suggesting that Europeans should engage in some real root cause
analysis. Adopting Libre-Halaal Digital Ecosystems at societal
level involve rejection of the Western IPR regime.</p><p>There are some indications that many Europeans have come to
recognize the fraudulence of the IPR regime. The key question is:
independent of America, what is Europe’s independent position on
the IPR regime?</p><p>We are hoping that at some point the Europeans can grow a
backbone. At what point could Europeans confront America and
split on the topic of IPR?</p>

wean itself from its reliance on the United States and that
Americans were guilty of anti-Japanese racism.</p><p>But then, all the American bases are still open in Japan and in South Korea.</p><p>When did the term “Intellectual Property” first enter the
Japanese language? Was it a translation?</p><p>The key question is: independent of America, what is Japan’s

</p><p>In Chapter <a href="#chap%3ASocietalAdoptionOfLibre-HalaalStrategies">19</a>
— chap:SocietalAdoptionOfLibre-HalaalStrategies, we
outlined a number of theoretical strategies that can be taken by
any society to move towards cures against the Western IPR regime
— which we view as a societal disease. There we introduced two
two basic strategies, “Inside of IPR Libre-Halaal Strategies” and
“Outside of IPR Libre-Halaal Strategies”.</p><p>In Chapter <a href="#chap%3AWesternSocietalLibre-HalaalStrategies">??</a> —
chap:WesternSocietalLibre-HalaalStrategies, we
described that for Western societies IPR cures are limited to
“Inside of IPR Libre-Halaal Strategies” and that these cures
are therefore quite weak. More than that can be done by Eastern
societies.</p><p>Obviously, rejecting or abolishing Western IPR regime, have
immense ramifications.</p><p>In a multi-polar world, it is realistic to recognize that IPR can become a
tear-point among poles. So, ramifications of Polyexistential Capitalism
in the West and outside of the West are very different.
The business and economics impacts are fundamental and existential.</p><p>When viewed properly, Digital Capitalism as Americans know it can
be turned upside-down. We have dedicated a chapter titled
“Global Polyexistential Capitalism” to this topic. It is really
only in the East that this can be done.</p><p>In this chapter, we focus on Eastern societies, with a particular emphasis on
China and Iran. We discuss both Inside and “Outside of IPR Libre-Halaal
Strategies” which are outlined in In Chapter <a href="#SocietalAdoptionOfLibre-HalaalStrategies">??</a>.</p><p>While much of this chapter focusses on China and Iran, similar
strategies are applicable to any other Eastern society (Brazil,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Cuba, etc.).</p><p>Our choice of Iran as a focus has several reasons. First, we
are Iran<a id="hevea_default138"></a>ian. Second, Iran<a id="hevea_default139"></a> is very well
positioned to consider the bold positions that are required for
proper adoption of policies towards becoming a Libre-Halaal
software based society. Having chosen already to challenge
Western neo-colonial agenda, Iran<a id="hevea_default140"></a>ians can relatively
easily conclude that the policies outlined in this section are in
Iran<a id="hevea_default141"></a>’s interest.</p><p>Our choice of China as a focus also has several reasons.
China is big enough and powerful enough to in due course stand
against the West and chalenge the legitimacy of the Western IPR
regime. The Chinese civilization is intrinsically more alligned
with the Libre-Halaal model.</p><p>The Western IPR regime is a vulnerable economic system. Eastern
sovereigns can do a number on Western IPR vulnerabilities.
Doing so requires deep understandings of the flaws and vulnerabilities
of the Western IPR regime and Libre-Halaal formulation of
polyexistential national policies that unleash natural forces that
work against the Western IPR regime.</p><p>Here we focus on such cultivations with a narrow focus on digital
ecosystems, software and Internet services in the context of
China and Iran.</p>

<h3 id="sec369" class="subsection">21.1.1  Build Consensus On Invalidity Of IPR in Iran</h3><!--SEC END --><p>Fortunately, a clear statement and rationale for illegitimacy of
the Western IPR regime has been made by Imam Khomeini. Imam
Khomeini<a id="hevea_default149"></a><a id="hevea_default150"></a>’s
position on this topic as described in Section
<a href="#sec%3AImamKhomeini%27sDecreeInvalidatesSo-CalledIntellectualPropertyRights">??</a>

sec:ImamKhomeini’sDecreeInvalidatesSo-CalledIntellectualPropertyRights,
paves the way towards what is needed from the society’s leaders
with regard to the question of: “What is the Halaal
Manner-Of-Existence Of Polyexistentials?”</p><p>The current situation in Iran is actually quite unclear, as it
has both accepted and rejected aspects of the Western IPR regime.
Over the recent years, many west-toxicated
Iranians have been pushing for mimicking Western copyright and patent models. And they
have had some success. So, with respect to acceptance or rejection of Western Intellectual
Property Rights regime, Iran’s position is quite muddy.</p><p>Iran is a non-signatory to <a id="hevea_default151"></a>WTO (<a id="hevea_default152"></a>Western Trade Organization)
copyright laws, but crisp full rejection of the concept of
copyright and patent as was explicitly stated by Imam
Khomeini<a id="hevea_default153"></a> has not been asserted again. In
recent years, a parallel to the Western IPR regime has been
shaping Iranian practices.</p><p>Moving towards a society based on halaal manner-of-existence of
software requires crisp declarations that fully invalidate Western
intellectual property rights regime. And, this is in Iranian society’s
best interest.</p><p>Acceptance or rejection of merits of Western IPR regime, above
all, is a moral and ethical question. Not a business or economics
question.</p><p>We humbly request for the Iranian Leader (Ayatollah Ozma Khamenei) and
other Shia Ayatollahs to reach consensus on “Property” as it relates
to polyexistentials. The theological aspects of “Property” are so
very fundamental in any religion and Islam in particular that lack of
a clear consensus amongst all sources of imitation can not be healthy.</p><p>The logic that we have presented in this document makes it clear that
polyexistentials can not be property and that the Western IPR regime
is erroneous. And mimicking the Western IPR should not be the Iranian
way.</p><p>We look to Shia sources of imitation to either endorse our logic and 
conclusions or point out to where they think we have gone wrong.</p><p>It is only through full rejection of the Western IPR regime that 
our theoretical Eastern societal cures can have a material impact.
Any Libre-Halaal software based formulation of national policies in Eastern societies
demands full rejection of the Western IPR regime.</p><p>Libre-Halaal software in general and Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital
Ecosystem thrives when Western IPR is rejected.</p><p>We also look to Shia sources of imitation to either endorse our
definitions of Libre-Halaal Software and Libre-Halaal Internet
Services or point us to their 
criteria for halaal manner-of-existence of software and 
their criteria for halaal manner-of-existence of internet services.</p>

<h3 id="sec370" class="subsection">21.1.2  Iranian Public Sector Libre-Halaal Strategies</h3><!--SEC END --><p>The Western IPR disease is being imposed on Easterners/Iranians
in the name of freedom and globalization. The 1979 revolution was
about the freedom of Iranians to be Iranians and to reject
American and Western models. In the realm of polyexistentials,
preservation of the Iranian independence demands formulation of
national polyexistential/digital policies.</p><p>Furthermore, absence of national digital policies or wrong
national digital policies result in loss of autonomy.</p><p>In the context of software, as an example, let’s consider the
dependence of Arabs and Iranians on American proprietary
software.</p><p>Today if you want to write in Farsi or in Arabic, your main
choice is Microsoft’s Proprietary-Haraam Windows environment. And
in the business driven (not societal or engineering driven)
western model, Perso-Arabic users are always second class
citizens because they represent an insignificant market to the
likes of American Microsoft and American Google. In other words
computing and communication capabilities of Perso-Arabic
societies is determined by Americans.</p><p>Eastern societies recognize this and see how Libre-Halaal Software can provide an alternative.</p><p>For example, what is maintained in <a href="http://www.persoarabic.org"><span style="font-family:monospace">http://www.persoarabic.org</span></a> provides an
alternative to the Proprietary Windows environment for Perso-Arabic processing. And

harm. But based on what logic, can Iranians have any assurance that the Windows operating
system itself has not been rigged to facilitate harm to Iran? Are we to be that naive to
assume that the American corporation producing Windows would not be collaborating with
those intending to inflect harm to Iran?</p><p>Then, Windows in its entirety should be considered a potential malware.</p><p>In fact this is true of any and all software that is not internally transparent and

it at all. Even when it is available at zero cost.</p>
<!--TOC section id="sec372" Theoretical Chinese Societal Digital Strategies-->
<h2 id="sec372" class="section">21.2  Theoretical Chinese Societal Digital Strategies</h2><!--SEC END --><p>In the 1970s, China decided to adopt an export oriented strategy.
This strategy was designed to help the country become more competitive in the
global market. The strategy focused on increasing exports of goods and services
while reducing imports. This allowed China to increase its foreign exchange
reserves and become a major player in the global economy. The strategy also
helped to create jobs and spur economic growth. Over the years, China has
continued to refine and improve its export-oriented strategy, and it has become
one of the most successful economies in the world.</p><p>The export-oriented strategy was also beneficial for China’s domestic economy.
By increasing exports, China was able to create jobs and increase incomes for
its citizens. This in turn helped to reduce poverty and improve living
standards.</p><p>50 years later, China, Europe and America are now economically fully interdependent.
China is the world’s largest exporter and the second-largest importer of goods
and services. Europe is the second-largest exporter and the third-largest
importer of goods and services. The United States is the world’s largest
importer and the third-largest exporter of goods and services.</p><p>IPR is intertwined in this trade picture.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec373" Building Consensus On Invalidity Of IPR in China-->
<h3 id="sec373" class="subsection">21.2.1  Building Consensus On Invalidity Of IPR in China</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
<a id="sec:BuildingConsensusOnInvalidityOfIPRinChina"></a>
</p><p>For China, adoption of Western IPR regime has been a side effect of its export
oriented strategy. China was required to adopt international
standards of intellectual property protection in order to gain
access to foreign markets. This meant that China had to implement
laws and regulations that would protect the intellectual property
rights of foreign companies operating in China. This included the
adoption of copyright, patent, and trademark laws, as well as the
establishment of an enforcement system to ensure that these laws
were followed. In addition, China also had to sign international
treaties and agreements that would ensure that its intellectual
property laws were respected by other countries.</p><p>So, China has been playing the Western IPR game because it has had
to. But, what is the historic and real position of intellectual
property in Chinese civilization?
What was Confucius’s position on intellectual property?</p><p>William Alford started a debate on this in 1995 with his book:
“To Steal a Book Is an Elegant Offense — Intellectual Property
Law in Chinese Civilization” [<a href="#NOTET"></a>]. The stong form of his claim is
along these lines: Confucianism militates against intellectual
property reforms in China. From the Westerner’s perspective this
accounts for the failure of the many reforms pushed by foreign
countries and intellectual property rights holders to induce
improvements in intellectual property protection and enforcement.
However, it is a fact that there are striking similarities
between Confucianism and what is generally regarded as the public
domain in the West. <sup><a id="text24" href="#note24">1</a></sup></p><p>Perhaps it would be an exaggeration to say that everything in
“To Steal a Book is an Elegant Offense” (Qie Shu Bu Suan Tou)
is an accurate characterization of intellectual property law in
Chinese civilization. However, there is no doubt that
intellectual property has a different place in Chinese
civilization compared to the West. Eastern perspective on IPR is
different. In the United States, intellectual property is
protected by the Constitution, while in Iran, Imam Khomeini
explicitly invalidated it. Thus, it is fair to say that at a
minimum, intellectual property is not an indigenous concept in
China. Rather it is one that has been imposed and imported.</p><p>In imperial China (221 B.C. — A.D. 1911), there were no formal
or informal regulations in place to protect the reproduction of
literary and other creative works which could be considered as
parallels to the Western copyright or other forms of intellectual
property law.<sup><a id="text25" href="#note25">2</a></sup></p><p>Similar to Iran and other Eastern societies, IP is not an
indigenous Chinese construct. As it is with Iran and
other Eastern societies, the Western IPR regime has been exported
and imposed by the Westerners onto China.</p><p>The Chinese know that intelectual property does not lead to
economic growth and inovation. In
Section <a href="#sec%3ADoesIPLead-NOTYET">??</a> —
sec:DoesIPLead-NOTYET, we cite various studies. Some of these studies
are based on research done by the Chinese in China.</p><p>So, given this mixture, what are the Chinese to do? We say, the
Chinese should consider all of what we have suggested in
Chapter <a href="#NOTYET">??</a> — NOTYET. And move towards and
independent national position on halaal maner-of-existence of
polyexistentals.</p>
<!--TOC subsection id="sec374" Preparing For A China That Can Say No-->

Chinese language manifesto which in someways parallels “The
Japan That Can Say No”.</p><p>Its full title is often translated as: “The China That Can Say No:
Political and Emotional Choices in the post Cold-War era”. It
became an overnight bestseller, as the authors called on the
Beijing government to stand up against the United States in a new
era of global competition. The popularity indicates the growth of
anti-American and anti-Japanese sentiment in the Chinese public.
It indicates disillusionment among many younger and better
educated Chinese as the nation searches for a major role in the
global economic and political systems.<sup><a id="text26" href="#note26">3</a></sup></p><p>Zhang Zangzang, one of the authors of China Can Say No, is a
former student radical and an “uncritical admirer of all things
American”. His disillusionment with foreign countries’ treatment
of China, and particularly that by America, reflects the
experience of about a quarter of Chinese students studying in the
United States, who, despite their initial Americophilia, undergo
a surge of Chinese patriotism upon their return. Contributing
factors to this transformation in the United States include
racial discrimination, denial of cultural legitimacy, and
negative media portrayal.<sup><a id="text27" href="#note27">4</a></sup></p><p>No English translation of China Can Say No has been published.</p><p>In the digital domain, what does it mean for China to say No? The
basic model of things like TikTok and Huawei is American and
Western. So far, China has been constructing its digital
ecosystem by replicating the American IPR model. But, what is the
independent Chinese model? We are claimimg that the Libre Halaal
model is the right model and that the Chinese can build on it.</p><p>Much preparation is needed in the digital domain before China can
say No. Most of that preparation can be done as “Inside of IPR

demonstrate how things have been pushed to absurdity. Here we include some that we 
consider particularly ridiculous and funny.</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
“Initiation Apparatus,” U.S. Pat. No. 819,814,
May 8, 1906 (“harmless” way of initiating a candidate into a fraternity by shocking him with

chase the light);

– sec:IPRituals:FormalIPvsPracticedIPvsEnforcedIP, we
describe how IP in general and patents in particular have become part of 
the Western business rituals.</p><p>Here we provide a case study for a set of specific patents that are in many
ways typical of what happens in practice. The role that patents play
in this case study is central. This case study demonstrates that
patents have become a “game” with all the players either being
pure economic actors or fully corrupt patent-believers. It further 
demonstrates that the players are not in it for 
building
anything meaningful. They are all in it just for the money.</p><p>The particular set of patents that we track in this case are all
continuations of U.S. Patent No. 5,808,415, (“the
’415 patent”) which was filed on
December 11, 1995. Unwired Planet is the assignee of
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,405,037 (“the ’037 patent”), 6,430,409 (“the
’409 patent”), and 6,625,447 (“the ’447 patent”) (collectively,
the “415-series-patents”).</p><p>With regard to this set of patents, all the rituals that we mentioned in 
Section <a href="#sec%3AIPRituals%3AFormalIPvsPracticedIPvsEnforcedIP">8.8</a> are practiced.
In this case, the patent-centered business rituals involve:</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Hollow patents which bring entrepreneurs and VCs together:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description">
Alain Rossmann and a few collaborators formed 
Libris, Inc. in 1996 around the ’415 patent intending to bring in Venture Capitalists (VCs).
Much VC money came in and 
Libris then became Unwired Planet which then became Phone.com and then Openwave and then back to Unwired Planet.
All of these names kept 415-series-patents central during the full pump-and-dump cycle.</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Rigged protocols which promote use of undeclared standard-essential patents (SEP):</span></dt><dd class="dd-description">
Wireless Application Protocols (WAP) were designed around the 415-series-patents.
And then the “WAP Forum” which became “Open Mobile Alliance” were formed to promote WAP.
Yet, the 415-series-patents were never decalred as standard-essential patents as it was not in 
the interest of the patent players to even be minimally honest.</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Patent oriented Pump-and-Dump and Spin-and-Flip schemes:</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> 
The stock prices peaked during the DotCon era (2000) and then started to collapse
as the patents and technology were hollow.</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Failed patented technology leading to product business sell-off.</span></dt><dd class="dd-description">

Federal Circuit issued the following ruling:</p><blockquote class="quote">
<div class="center">
CONCLUSION 
</div><p>For the foregoing reasons, and because we find that Unwired
Planet’s remaining arguments are without merit, we conclude
that the district court properly construed the claim terms at

</blockquote><p>In that document we had explicitly identified the ’415 patent and had warned about WAP technology
being booby trapped with patents. The relevant section is reproduced below:</p><blockquote class="quote"><p>2.3 Not Patent-Free</p><p>...</p><p>The WAP specification, however, is burdened with
several patent restrictions. These include
patents held by certain members of the WAP Forum
itself, most notably Phone.com and Geoworks.
Patent infringement claims have already been made
by the holders of the following patents:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
U.S. Patent # 5,327,529 (Geoworks). Process of designing user’s
interfaces for application programs.</li><li class="li-itemize">U.S. Patent # 5,809,415 (Phone.com, formerly Unwired Planet).
Method and architecture for an interactive two-way data
communication network.</li></ul><p>More patent infringement claims can almost
certainly be expected in the future.</p></blockquote><p>About 12 years after writing that document when the ’415 patent was
asserted against Apple and RIM, we were considered prescient. Irell
and Manella LLP on behalf of RIM found us and hired us to assist in
defending the patent assertions.</p><p>The life cycle of these typical patents demonstrate that the
rituals surrounding patent law really amounts to a negative-sum
game.</p><p>Alain Rossmann and collaborators made a whole lot of money through
using the 415-series-patents as a basis for a pump-and-dump
scheme. Many new investors lost money. A whole lot of lawyers made some money. As patent
defense engineering consultants we too made some money – our services are available
only in defense against patent assertions.</p><p>But, in the aggregate nothing of enduring value was created as a result
of the 415-series-patents. And we now have a Patent Assertion Entity
in charge of the patents.</p><p>Not patented alternative technologies became enduring solutions.</p><p>We would all have been better off if the 415-series-patents did not exist,
or better yet, if the patent system did not exist.</p>
