That which exists in nature in multiples, we call polyexistentials. Information
and knowledge exist in nature in multiples. Information and knowledge are
polyexistentials. This is in contrast with what exists in nature in singular
which we call monoexistentials.
In this document we analyze the topic of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
from a new perspective. The topic of restriction of polyexistentials and
Western IPR are one and the same. Yet, the concept of polyexistentials has not
appeared in prior discussions of this topic. This is the very first time that
the concept and the word “polyexistetials” are being introduced.
Models of ownership of subjects can only be considered valid only when they are
consistent with forms of possession and existence of subjects. Manner of
existence and possession of polyexistentials make them unownable.
The concept of polyexistence makes the fraudulence of Western IPR clear and
obvious.
Beyond rejecting Western IPR and calling for its abolishment we introduce the
\"Libre-Halaal\" label for the halaal manner-of-existence of polyexistentials
towards proper models for their governance. Based on that, we then provide
definitional criteria for Libre-Halaal_Software and Libre-Halaal_Internet
Services.
Towards a cure, as a a moral alterantive to the proprietary american digital
ecosystem we put forward the The_Libre-Halaal_ByStar_Digital_Ecosystem.
Equipped with our blueprint and our initial implementation of the ByStar
digital ecosystem we then turn our attention to economics and business. We
introduce the model of Global_Polyexistential_Capitalism and based on that
bring forward Neda’s_Open_Business_Plan_for_ByStar.
Our main goal for all of this has been to influence societal policies towards
adoption of halaal manner-of-existence of polyexistentials in Eastern societies
in general and Iran in particular. The last chapter of this document focuses on
the model of Libre-Halaal polyexistentials as a replacement for the Western IPR
regime.",
