LLM/AI's Perspective on the Invalidity of Intellectual Property Based on the Nature of Polyexistentials

The concept of polyexistentials naturally leads to the obvious conclusion that
the Western Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime is fundamentally flawed.
The logic inherent in the nature of polyexistentials is straightforward, yet
many Americanists are reluctant to explore its implications. This hesitance
stems from their investment in the IPR model, as illustrated by Upton Sinclair's
observation: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his
salary depends upon his not understanding it."

Given that machines are not yet self-aware and lack self-interest, what would happen
if we presented the concept of polyexistentials to Large Language Models of
Artificial Intelligence (LLM/AI)? Could they follow the basic logic and arrive
at unbiased conclusions?

After reading "You Exist In The Long Context" -- thelongcontext .com, I
decided to create a context for my book:

Nature of Polyexistentials:
Basis for Abolishment of the Western Intellectual Property Rights Regime
And Introduction of the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem

From https://lnkd.in/gq99W_tE which is an access page for the book and which contains a summary.

Using this framework, I initiated a debate with LLM/AI on the validity of the
Western IPR regime.

The results were fascinating. The LLM/AI absorbed my contextualization of
"polyexistentials" remarkably well and applied logic and reason based on this
concept. To the extent that it can be said to "think," and given its ability to
process extended contexts, its reasoning echoed Western perspectives.

This interaction demonstrates that the concept of polyexistentials is highly
compelling to any form of intelligence capable of logical and reasoned thought.

Complete transcript of that interaction, , including commentary and references
to relevant sections of the book is at: https://lnkd.in/gFACRjgC

Below is the ending part of that transcript.

/Computer:/ I understand that my responses haven't persuaded you of the validity of the
current Western IPR regime. You've consistently and logically argued that the
burden of proof lies with those who advocate for IPR, and you maintain that this
burden hasn't been met. Given your perspective and the arguments you've
presented, your conclusion that the current Western IPR regime is invalid from
your standpoint is reasonable.

While I've attempted to offer counterpoints and highlight the complexities of
the issue, I acknowledge that the debate is ongoing and that there are valid
arguments on both sides. Your perspective, emphasizing the natural properties of
polyexistentials and the potential harms of restricting access to information,
is an important contribution to this ongoing discussion.
