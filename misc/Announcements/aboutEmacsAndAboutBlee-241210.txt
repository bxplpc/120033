About Emacs and About Blee

Dear Colleague,

More than 40 years ago, Emacs emerged as a highly customizable text editor,
built around a powerful Lisp engine. Emacs is among the oldest free and open
source projects still under development. I started using Emacs at around 1986.

Over the decades, Emacs has become a platform where engineers have integrated
support for virtually everything. Its foundational abstractions have made it a
uniquely convivial and versatile usage environment. VS Code is only comparable
to a subset of Emacs. During this journey, Emacs has fostered a variety of
cultures and subcultures around its extensions, configurations, and
customizations.

One notable example of this communal spirit is EmacsConf, a yearly virtual
conference dedicated to celebrating Emacs and Emacs Lisp. EmacsConf-2024 took
place on December 7th and featured a wide range of fascinating presentations.
Recordings of these talks, including their Q&A sessions, are now available at
emacsconf. org.

My own contribution to this year's conference was a talk titled:

 "About Blee: Enveloping Our Own Autonomy-Directed Digital Ecosystem with Emacs"

The video recording is available on youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa6tjBXZiTU

To better understand Blee, let’s break down the subtitle of my presentation:

   "Enveloping Our Own Autonomy Directed Digital Ecosystem With Emacs."

  - "Enveloping": Blee is designed to fully integrate and encapsulate usage of
     an entire digital ecosystem.

  - "Our Own Autonomy-Directed Digital Ecosystem": Unlike the proprietary
     ecosystems of Google, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Amazon, Blee is part of
     the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem. ByStar prioritizes autonomy and
     privacy, offering an ethical alternative to the surveillance oriented
     American digital ecosystem.

By* challenges the existing proprietary American digital ecosystem while
operating concurrently alongside it. By* is about redecentralization of internet
application services.

Some might dismiss ByStar as an ambitious, utopian vision. In response, I am
putting my book on the table. Think of this book as an interdisciplinary
blueprint.

 Nature of Polyexistentials:
 Basis for Abolishment of the Western Intellectual Property Rights Regime
 And Introduction of the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem

Emacs, with its powerful display engine, elisp, and multi-lingual input method
engines, along with its robust agent paradigm and extensibility, provides an
ideal foundation for the usage environment of ByStar.

I invite you to explore Blee and share your feedback.

With respect and hope, I remain at your service,
