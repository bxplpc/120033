SHORT DESCRIPTION  

In this book we analyze the topic of Intellectual Property Rights
(IPR) from a new perspective. The topic of restriction of polyexistentials and
Western IPR are one and the same. Yet, the concept of polyexistentials has not
appeared in prior discussions of this topic. This is the very first time that
the concept and the word “polyexistetials” are being introduced.

Knowledge, know-how, uses of know-how, ideas and information are inherently
non-scarce. They are polyexistentials. Unlike monoexistentials which exist in
singular, polyexistentials naturally exist in multiples and are inherently not
scarce. What is abundant in nature is being made artificially scarce through
man-made ownership rules called copyright and patents. These ownership rules
then permit a certain group which usually take the form of corporations to
economically profit from these unnatural and economically motivated artificial
scarcities. The model of polyexistence makes it easy to demonstrate that the
concept of Intellectual Property is invalid. This proof is based on logic that
is rooted in nature of existence and nature of possession and the requirement
for ownership to be in harmony with nature of possession and existence.

Having rejected the Western IPR regime as an erroneous model for govenrnance of
polyexistentials, we introduce the Libre-Halaal model of governance of
polyexistentials towards facilitating conviviality of tools. We then focus on
the digital world and introduce the The Libre-Halaal By* (ByStar) Digital
Ecosystem, as a moral alternative to the existing proprietary American digital
ecosystem.

Equipped with a multidisciplinary blueprint, we offer our initial
implementation of the ByStar digital ecosystem as a starting point towards
concrete solutions. Todays’s American Internet is mostly a business construct.
The current basic model of internet is rooted in the rise-of-the-middle model of
corporations exploiting the individual. The engineering architecture of the
proprietary internet application services is very central. Proprietary American
corporations the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple are
positioned in the middle and monitor, control and expolit citizens of the world.
The engineering architecture of Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem is
distinctly different. The multidisciplinary blue print that we have provided can
be the basis for de-Americanization, de-IPR-ization and redecentralization of
internet application services.

We are pro-business. We are devout monoexistential bounded-corporations
capitalists. The existing capitalist model for monoexistentials is generally
correct, in both philosophical and economic terms. But the extension of the
monoexistential capitalist model into the domain of polyexistentials, based on
the Western IPR regime, is a grave mistake. To address this mistake of American
Capitalism, we introduce the model of Global Polyexistential Capitalism as an
Attribution Based Economy towards correcting the existing IPR rooted Ownership
Based Economy of American Capitalism. Deep understanding of the strategy that we
outline in this book, makes it clear that Polyexistential American Capitalism is
very vulnerable.

Our ultimate goal for all of this has been to influence
societal policies towards adoption of halaal manner of-existence of
polyexistentials. We recognize that adoption of such societal policies in
America is likely not possible and their adoption in the West is likely very
difficult. Therefore, we focus on Eastern societies in general and Iran and
China in particular. It is only through full rejection of Western IPR regime and
its deep roots in Americanism that humanity can be rescued.
 
Distinct and Different: 

What we are trying to do in this book is distinct and different from the many
other books and articles that have been written about Intellectual Property.
First, most books on this topic are written by Western lawyers, politicians,
economists, journalist, sociologists and academics. We are engineers and we are
not Western. Second, this is the very first time that the philosophical concept
and terminology of polyexistentials is being used to analyze this topic and this
domain. Third, our treatment of this subject is genuinely independent. We are
not doing it for money or hype. Finally, unlike most other writings on this
topic which amount to naggings of impotents, we are putting a blueprint for a
cure on the table. As engineers, we are offering explicit multidisciplinary
solutions.
